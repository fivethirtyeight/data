So I chose to strongly contest 4 spots which would allow me to get that score if I only one those (9, 8, 7, and 4).  For each of the remaining spots I chose to place a single troop in case someone also heavily contests one of these numbers but leaves another spot entirely uncontested.  Finally I chose numbers ending in 1 because I assumed that many people would choose round numbers and therefore I would have some chance of barely beating them."

Assuming this is the strategy most people seek to optimize on I wanted to build a strategy that would beat these strategies. Every four base must win either castle 10 or castle 8 to reach this 28 point threshold (which is the primary way they win). After that the number of troops sent to the other castles should be greater than with a four castle strategy that you win the rest of the needed points on the castles that others gave over for free. I would like to test it with 30 in bases 8,10 and 5 troops in 1 and 3 as well but I think you need to make sure you juice your troop count in the bases you are going for because if you don't win at least one of those you are going to be in trouble. You will also lose to a split evenly strategy but I don't think that will be popular as most people will look at the data and realize you probably want to have a win condition."
1,1,4,4,22,22,17,17,6,6,"I started with attempting to punish those who didn't send enough troops to the 'Extremes' (Castles 1-4 & Castle 9-10).  Sending less than 5 will result in a loss at 9 & 10, and sending 0 or 1 to the first 4 will result in a loss.  Next, I want to win at least 2 (hopefully 3) of Castles 5-8 so I went with 22 at 5 & 6 since previous winners from the first 2 iterations sent a max of 21.  Finally, I distributed my last troops evenly to Castle 7 & 8."

1,4,9,10,1,13,16,17,14,15,I assumed the number of soldiers necessary based a trend from the previous two events.  I then added one soldier to castles 6 through 10 and subtracted one soldier from castles 1-5.

Holding the top 3 pts Castles will only get to 27 pts; however, holding point 7 will get 34 pts, but that an extra six points not needed. So, having strong defenders on the top 3 castles, of which in previous games few went above 30 to hold, and then holding castle 1 strongly, will give the best opportunity to hold the least castles with the least wasted points to win.

But if one is lost, all is lost. :)"

2,2,9,11,16,10,30,5,8,7,Based on last year's deployments I observed that very few soldiers were deployed to the 9 and 10 castles so I send a force to that could take both of those.

Well for a similar reason why your website is called 538. 55 is the number of total points a player could win in this game, but 28 is the number of points a player needs to win, like 270 in an election. If a player can get to 28 points then he automatically wins. (Said player can win with less if there are ties). 

Instead of viewing the board as 55 points I can win, I view it as 28 points I need to win. That being said, each point is worth 3.57 of my soldiers (100/28). I am making an assumption, that most people will undervalue lower point tiers. Putting 3, 5, and 7 soldiers on tiers 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 15% of my soldiers, but gains 21% of the points needed. A major victory for my army. 

4 and 5 are tricky. They are needed to win if you go the 10,9,5,4 strategy (last season's winners did). But they were overcommitted to those areas. Being wary of losing them due to people overcommitting on them, I left them at 2. Every soldier needs someone to guard his back. Pick up the easy win vs those who bid 0 or 1, but don't lose out on those playing the 10,9,5,4 strategy. Probably a minor loss for my army. 

6,7,8 are much easier. They deserve 21, 25, and 28 soldiers respectively (using 3.57x *point value). But they are also VERY underappreciated by both past winners, and the average submission. Capitalizing on this, I can gain these points by using a decent amount of soldiers, but near the amount they deserve. Another major victory for my army. I can count on wins by using only 15, 18, and 20. 

This leaves me with 9 and 10. And 28 troops. If history tells us anything, its that people like castle 9 more than they like castle 10. This is an either or situation, you won't win both unless you overcommit. I place all 28 in castle 10.

I have chosen to fight hard for the 4 highest values, in hopes that most spread their troops more conservatively. Because Castle 7 is included in both of these combinations, it is likely to be highly contested, so I have placed a third of my troops there. 1 troop was distributed to all castles in the lower 6 to snag extra points in case of similar strategies, or to those which chose not to contest certain castles. This strategy only works if I am able to win all 4 top castles, so this beats the winning Feb 2017 strategy of aiming low, but not the Jun 2017 strategy of splitting between 9/10 and 4/5.

brake the cores of the main strategies, but don't give up all the others in the process.
For some reason, 5 and 4 seem to be the most popular choices, so it seemed essential to steal one of these.  I chose 5 because it's worth more points.
The 2nd part is trickier, because now half the players go for 9 and 10, and the other half go for 8 and 7.  I decided to be bold in 10, dedicating far more troops than almost any of the other players would. Then, put enough of the remaining troops spread across the other three options.

Given 100 soldiers, the specific numbers just sort of shook out that way.

Round 1 winners went strong for upper-middle and low numbers to get to 28 -- something like 8,7,5,4,3,1. In response, round 2 winners went strong specifically for 10, 9, 5, and 4. I'm countering those while still focusing on my primary strategy: try hard to get my primary targets to get to 28 points, while giving myself a chance on the other castles if I happen to lose one or two of my primary targets. Running against the previous 10 finalists I'd finish 9-1, and the one loss is 28-27, so mine may be a popular winning strategy as a counter to those, just as the leaders in previous iterations of the game used similar strategies to each other.

This means that my average opponent will aim to hold four castles, worth 28 victory points and will deploy 25 troops to each. 

There are (by my very quick, admittedly) count, 9 unique strategic combinations of four castles that get to the victory threshold. I assume that my opponents are indifferent about which one they choose and arrive at whichever one they wish to play randomly.

I use the frequency with which a castle worth a given number of victory points appears in one of the 9 unique four-castle strategies to generate the probability that my average opponent, within my simplifying assumptions, would place troops at that castle, and subsequently, how many soldiers (on average) I expect to be stationed at that castle. 

I would then simply distribute my 100 soldiers so I had marginally more at each castle than my opponent. Noting the inherent risk of this strategy (every battle should be a draw if my opponents play as I do, or as I expect them to give or take a trembling hand or two), I (rather randomly) decide that the castles worth 1 or 2 victory points are of low strategic value, given how infrequently they are included in 4-castle strategy and redistribute the six troops I would have placed there in the purer form of my strategy to the castles worth 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 and 5 VPs.

Once I looked at the last match, I saw that this had been a popular choice for the leaders, confirming its soundness. My draft distribution lost against those leaders, though, due to weakness in the 8-7-6 range. I also noticed that the bulk of forces were being sent against castle 9, producing uncertainty around the success of even a healthy amount of force there. To adjust, I reduced allocation to castle 9, redistributing those troops across castles 9-8-7-6, but left my highest concentrations at 10, 5, and 4. I ultimately ceded castle 1, because I assessed the value of an additional soldier to win a 4+ castle as higher than avoiding the 1 point loss (and most likely, the Battle for Castle One will be a quiet 0-0 match, yielding a free .5 point anyway)."

To do this, I picked another one to punt on (Castle 7) guessing that that is a sweet spot in terms of points I can lose and where I think others will load up. My strategy is going to require me to win almost all the castles to which I committed significant troops (which is somewhat risky—but I think really the only way to go) or to steal a lot from the castles I committed few (but not zero) troops to. That seems like an unlikely path to victory but a decent hedge against someone that stacks all of their troops on Castles 7-10. I am quite worried about a 25-25-25-25 or a 27–26-24-23 deployment, so I decided to put 26 in Castle 8 which should give me a victory over all of those.

I think a lot of people are going to try to reach 28 troops by taking 10,9,8 and 1. This makes sense intuitively, because you're defending the fewest number of tiles, but it would mean glossing over 7-2, and I doubt many of those people would put more than a quarter of their troops on castle 1. I'm also trying to maintain enough troops on 7-2 to beat anyone who just assigns 10 troops per castle.

I would still get them by sweeping 1-7.

Honestly that's pretty much what I'm doing too, but rather than competing for the top 4, the idea is to scoop up the bottom 7, while tossing a bone to the top 3 castles to hopefully outdo anyone who is using a similar bottom-up strategy.

The idea is that, while most people will invest a lot into the top castles (because they are valuable and because they expect others to do the same), many will not invest much into the bottom castles. This makes them (hopefully) cheap to obtain, and allows a pretty hefty force to go to castle 7 to (again, hopefully) outdo those who want castle 7, but who value it 4th most."

My goal with this deployment was not to beat the top performers - it was to beat the field. Beating the #1 warlord is the same as beating anyone else after all.

I decided on this strategy by coming up with several theories on how to win, and testing them against an approximation of “the field” I created using the data provided by the previous contests and a Gaussian number generator. 333 “participants” were based off of the data from the first contest, 666 from the second, each of the top 5 strategies got 15 entries, and to make it an even 1150 the last participant placed 10’s in each castle.

Hopefully there aren’t too many people who copy-paste the winning lists, otherwise I’ll lose!

If I win a large castle narrowly, this is the best scenario, but an overwhelming loss is also acceptable (since it will cost my opponent many troops to achieve this, and therefore give me numerical superiority elsewhere). It's like the electoral college!

In the previous rounds, players deployed troop amounts on the large castles that were either very small or very large. My strategy depends on my expectation that this pattern will repeat itself. I chose all of my troop placements with this in mind, determined not to lose any large castle narrowly against either of those strategies.

I invested heavily into castles 9 and 10, expecting to win their points almost every time. If I win one or both of them narrowly, then this is a significant boon to my efficiency. If I win them overwhelmingly, this is not as good, but for 19 points I'm willing to take the risk. I expect to defeat most players who conduct a predictable attack on one or both of these castles. If I lose either of these castles after such a large investment then I probably lose the match.

I expect to do well in castles 3, 6, 7, and 8. I'm vulnerable to opponents who attack three or more of these simultaneously with medium-sized forces while conceding castles 9 and 10, as some top finishers did in the first round, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. Any two of these mid-range castles, plus the 19 points above will give me the 28 points necessary for the win.

Castles 4 and 5 seem to have been highly overvalued in the earlier rounds, so I did not contest them at all. I am hoping to take an overwhelming loss here against opponents who try this again. If I lose them narrowly, that's unfortunate, but it won't matter too much. My path to 28 points is fairly difficult to block even without them."

These players then competed in another tournament and I took out the top 5 players (top of the top players as I call them). Then I repeated this whole thing 99 more times to get 500 top of the top players. 

From these 500 top of the top players, I calculated the median placements for each battlefield. 

Then I repeated the above until I had a 10 medians for each battlefield. I took the mean of each battlefields medians and used the 10 means to calculate my strategy. 

I begin by allocating 1 soldier to each battlefield and set this as my starting configuration. Then I calculated the points per median soldier allocation for each battlefield. This would give me a way to rank which battlefields should be allocated to first. 

Going according to the highest points per median soldier allocation battlefield, I added to the battlefield the floor of the respective battlefields mean of medians. I went down the rankings until I ran out of soldiers or finished allocating to the last battlefield. 

If there were any remaining soldiers, I allocated one by one to the battlefield that had the highest points per soldier if adding one more soldier meant I won that battlefield.

Not only did all the top deployments from round 2 follow that strategy, but deployments optimized against the first two rounds' results (and deployments optimized against optimized deployments!) follow it also, sometimes even more strongly. That has left me perfectly torn between two opposite approaches - take the obvious lesson, invest heavily in 4 castles and try to win that way (which would mean a deployment like 0-0-11-0-0-23-1-2-36-27); or assume that everybody will try 4-castle approaches now, and optimize against them while still scoring decently against other plans. I've changed my mind about a dozen times, and finally decided to do the latter. I'm tackling the 4-castlers head-on in castles 3, 6 and 9 (a 4-castle plan needs to go through at least one of those), and putting more than just a token presence in castles 7, 8 and 10 because simulations. The problem is that unlike the 4-castle approach, which is essentially dumb-plan-proof, my approach loses to simple deployments like 1-3-5-7-9-11-13-15-17-19 or even the dreaded ""put ten guys in every castle and pray""; and because my presence in castle 3 isn't that great I'm somewhat vulnerable to a 10-8-7-3 plan too. But the advantage is that fewer people will likely try this approach than the 4-castle one; even if the 4-castle approach turned out to be the winning approach in general, there's no guarantee that I personally would win; whereas if this is the basic winning approach, my chances of winning or placing high should be good.

Splitting the difference, I focused on ONE of 9&10 and ONE of 7&8. ""Focus"" meant 3 troops per point awarded, economically exceeding the average amount of nearly two (100/55 = 1.8). I added focus to enough midlevel castles to generate a minimal winning score of 28 (Castles 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 = 28). That took up 84 troops total for focus areas. Near the bottom I was highly economical, figuring zero troops at Castle 1 and one troop at Castle 2, which I figure will win me an occasional half point and even an infrequent point. The remaining 15 troops were to be split up into scouting parties for Castles 3, 5, 7, and 9, roughly in proportion to reward (2, 3, 4, and 5 troops) with one untidy troop reassigned to Castle 10 to beat anybody who overuses nice round numbers in the most effective possible place.

I recommend, after the main contest's round robin, you try scoring it a different way: a series of round robins for which only the top teams survive; keeping only the first 2^n teams (n being the largest number such that 2^n is smaller than the number of entrants) and keeping half after each successive round robin.

The last warlords competition saw 4 of the top 5 winners with the combination 10,9,5,4 (also employing the 28 point strategy). I’m unsure of whether this means we will see more or less of this particular combination, however 7 of the 9 found before use castle 10 and 6 use castle 9.  I decided to go with 3 heavy hitters in 8,9,10 so that I could spend less on my 4th castle in castle 1.
On choosing the amounts, the first warlords page provided some very useful information on the underlying statistics of the distribution. I noticed this was missing from the next time, so I made some inferences. We see the skewed distribution for just about all 10 castles, so the median should nearly always be lower than the mean – and in this case significantly so. So choosing the amounts for castles 8,9, and 10 I based off the mean (and previous winners for an approximate upper range) to establish a point where my guess would be safely in the 90%ile or higher for each.
For the remainder of castles, I feel leaving them empty is unwise – as most of the time my selections for 1,8,9, and 10 should all win against normal opponent selections – for castles 2 through 7 I was debating leaving anywhere from 1 to 3 to defend.  I landed on 1 in the interest of increasing defense for my primary 4, but so that in the fringe case that somebody defeats one of my castles I have a chance to gain points back if they leave something undefended.

-The champion sets of the other two had about an 80% win rate. That seems like a good target for this time.
-The champion set from the second iteration would have done well on the first. It makes sense to make something that would have done well in the others.
-The champion set from the first iteration would have gotten obliterated in the second. It's a good idea not to repeat either of the champions.
-The top sets from the first iteration prioritized 8, 7, 5 and at least one of 6 and 4.
-The top sets from the second iteration prioritized 10, 9, 5, and 4.
-That one person had fractional troops in the second iteration. That seems good and reduces the need to consider draws. Also, that allows one to overshoot a target by a smaller degree, freeing up backups for less-guarded castles.

I found the 80th percentile number for each castle from each iteration. I then took the higher of these 80th percentilers of the two iterations and created the set (4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 21, 25, 31, 29, 23). I then treated that as a single entry and found roughly the cheapest way to beat it to 28 points--targeting 10, 7, 6, and 5. I was able to cover these with 85.4 troops. Of course, if I target only those, I have to win every single one of them, or I lose. For that reason, I chose to post a small contingency in 9 and 2 (which will cover me in the case that I lose either 10 or both 6 and 5...  2 had a significantly lower barrier than 3/4, and 9 was somehow softer than 8). I then gave 0.1 troops to 1, 3 and 4 to ensure I outright win any undefended castles. Castle 8 seemed weird to do just 0.1 for, so I threw 1.1 there. Then, adding one more troop to 6 and 7 seemed to have a very good ROI for the other two iterations, so I went ahead and did that.

Final stray observations: I wish I had marked my other two entries in such a way that I could identify them easily. I feel like this one will stand out in the data a lot better (though I suspect a few others will utilize decimal troops as well)."

Ultimate: castle/28*100+1 for castle 8,9,10
Lucky7: castle/28*100 for castles 1 to 7
Troll: 47,53 on castle 9 and 10 respectively.

The wager basically assumes that allowing the lesser castles to go undefended and the more valuable cases to go undefended, that I would be able to grab more points in total by winning castle 4, 5, 7, and 8.

I won't account for expected human choices, but I will allow the previous winners to be represented on the battle field to see how they do. My expectation is this will be close to a GTO approach in the sense that it will be hard for others to guess and exploit the strategy. On the other hand, since we'll be playing against a bunch of other humans, it wouldn't surprise me if I get killed by an exploitive strategy. FWIW, this field crushed my initial guess at a good strategy (focus on 10, 9, 6, 3 to get to 28 points). This deployment was based on results from a 60,000 random assortment.

Deployment had to defeat/tie some of the default, non-strategic assignments (e.g., 10 everywhere, 25s in each 7-10, % assignment based on value).  Castles 5 (main counter to round two strategies), 7 (main counter to round one strategies), and 8 (some round one strategies) can break a lot of opponent strategies so contesting them is where my main investment took place.
