Goal is to get to 28 points, though in general you also want to keep in mind that you want to win the castles you win by just a little, and lose the ones you lose big time. This deployment looks to probably get to that 28 point margin by winning 4,5,9, and 10 most often. But the scout size of 3-5 is designed to try to be a couple steps ahead of the adjusters who are presenting 2-3 scouts after the previous run. I also wanted to watch out for people loading on 8,9,10, and 1, which was a reasonable strategy last time, which is why I loaded pretty heavily into 9 (which I still expect to be less contested than 10).

As a final note, I also think it would be interesting to look at which strategies do best in terms of total differential to opponents, and how that differs from the actual winners of the contest as published."

Based on this, there's an inherent tradeoff between allocating troops in lower valued castles and allocating lots of troops in just a few of the high valued castles. So this set up focuses on the top two castles, the six point castle and the three point castle, which if captured would yield a majority of the victory points.

With that in mind he still had 70 troops to send out. The general was greedy and decided he liked the look of the two largest castles, one as his home and the other as a guest house so he sent a sizeable platoon to those two. Expecting to secure at least one of the two palaces he admired most he set his 60 remaining loyal soldiers to fight for 4 other palaces. He decided to send some troops to the third outpost, a small group of buildings barley worth fighting over. The forth and fifth castles also looked inviting so he sent an larger group to them. He then had 20 soldiers left over, all eager for battle. He decided that they would be best suited to attacking the seventh fort, a fine set of buildings which were reasonably contested in previous battles. He decided that this would be where his stronghold would be and decided to command the army from there. The night before the attack a trio of soldier approached the general saying they were told to attack the smallest of the forts. They thought that their attack was pointless and against many enemies they wouldn't be needed so they requested to be promoted. The general considered this that night and in the morning he approached the three soldiers and told them he agreed with them and thought they would be more useful to him in the squadron fighting for his proposed guest house.

Also, looking at the distributions from last time, many people went with 0,1, or 2 troops at some relatively high value castles, so I set a minimum of 3 troops per castle to round up some cheap points- that fits with a strategy where you want to win a castle by having just one more troop than your opponent at a given castle.

In the case of 10 castles, there are 81 nearest neighbors, which can be found by adding a single troop to one castle while subtracting one from another. This strategy finds locally optimal solutions (not better than any neighbor), but by re-starting the solver from different random entries, one can be relatively certain (~95%) of having found the global optima after around 100 random starts. I used this to find all locally optimal solutions greater than the 90th-percentile entry in the original field. Since some of those entries are very close to each other (but greater than one step obviously), I filtered those for only the top solutions more than 5 steps apart to avoid repeating similar strategies.

I used Excel VBA to simulate the last set of battles. I then weighted how well each plan did based on its win% in the last battle. I then reran the whole series of battles assigning weights to each strategy based on its winning percentage. 

After thinking for a while I decided to weight each plan using its win % squared. This mean that if a plan won 80% of its battles (the best plan were around that) it would count as .64 while decent plans (those with a win% of 60) would count as .36. In addition any plan that won less than 20% was considered to be a ""troll"" plan and I counted those all as if they had won 60% since I assume there will still be more people who troll this round as well.

I then ran each strategy again to find the best weighted winning strategy from last round. It turned out to be (0,3,4,7,16,24,4,34,4,4). 

Surprisingly the top strategies were still pretty much the same. I expected strategies that went for the 10 or other counter strategies to be more effective but even with much higher weights they were not.

After this I ran another macro that look at every combination of 1 increase and 1 decrease to pick the best strategy. This continued until I got t the point where the plan did not get a better weighted winning percentage with any possible change which is mf final answer.

Interestingly the same answer actually also won if I used winning percentage to the 1.5 power. This confirm my strategy."

I donŠ—Èt think putting an even distribution of straight 10s is going to work because itŠ—Ès an easy strategy to counter. So I decided to arbitrarily select a pathway to 28 points (2+4+5+7+10) to be my concentration, trying to sidestep the relative popularity of 8 and 9, and evenly distributed the remaining soldiers to these five locations.

The tool would also then test all 90 movements of a single soldier from the first deployment, take the highest scorer, and start again with that deployment until it reached a (local) maximum score.

For starting points, I took the previous top 5, plus some random deployments to see if I could improve on them by chance - I couldn't.

A couple of deployments stood out as the best, but I suspected other players might find them (who knows), so I fed them back into the test set and re-ran the process. This is where I ended up."

0,1,2,2,2,22,26,32,3,10,"I took the original data set. I made a table of how many strategies each number of soldiers would beat at each castle. ie 5 soldiers in castle 1 would beat 1175 strategies. this created the function w(x,y) where w is the number of wins, x is the castle and y is the number of soldiers.

I then used that to calculate how much each group of soldiers is worth x=number of the castle y= number of soldiers p=points. 1387 is the total number of strategies. 
p(x,y)=((x*w(x,y)+ (x/2)*(w(x,y)-w(x,y+1))/1387)

For this for formula there is a mytic 101st solider who beats everyone

I then calculated at each x,y the value of each solider by calculating
p(x,y)/y
and the incremental value of each solider 
p(x-y)-p(x,y-1)

I graphed the later to see any spikes where one more solider means a lot. Using the graph a created a cutoff of  .3 and whenever a new solider and using the latest point each solider was worth .3 I recorded those numbers. Then left me well over 100. I changed to cutoff to .35. The left me with 91 soldiers so I looked for places where the drop off wasn't great so I add the one to series 6 (incremental value .33) and  one to series 8 (additional value .15). The remaining 7 soldiers didn't have any real good places to go so I sent to all to Castle 10 guess that because it was under fought for last time it might get pushed outward.

using p(x,y) for my strategy i came up with a total expected point value of 33.60 well above the need 27.5 points to win 

With more time I might be able to find a more optimal strategy. looking just at the p(x,y)/y and taking the highest number of soldiers where each solider is worth .275 (total points needed/100) yield exactly 100 soldiers but gives only an expected value of 27.79 points.

For comparison, if you were to split soldiers evenly between all points the ratio would be ~1.8 soldiers/point. The top teams were targeting about 28-30 points, while still sending soldiers to each castle.

2,6,8,12,15,18,28,3,4,4,"My assumption is that many people will base their new strategy off of the winning strategy from last time or one of the contenders, or will implement similar strategies to that. Alternately, there are still the possibilities of people submitting the average number of troops (or similar, such as sending 0 or 1 to castle 10 and then the average * 1.2 to the remaining castles). So my strategy is focused on beating similar strategies as last time while not losing to the averages.

I'm assuming the way people will try to adapt the strategy of the winner is to do one of the following: apply similar metrics but with different castles contested (sending 2 to high value noncontested castles, about 2 x Value troops to high value must-win castles, and about 1.5 x Value troops to low value castles); OR implement a strategy that strictly dominates the winner of last time. And some will still send in things similar to the average.

My strategy is designed to win high value castles where neither of us are trying hard to win (sending 4 instead of 2 to castles 9 and 10, and 3 to castle 8). Where I contest must-win castles, I've added 2 to the winner from last time to beat out someone who adds 1 troop over the winner or applied a similar point multiple to the number of troops I'm sending (castles 4, 5, 6, 7). And castles 1 and 3 are contested with similar numbers of troops somewhere between the average and the winner from last time.

I chose 1000 ""random"" configurations, each constructed by placing troops 1-by-1, with the chance that a troop goes to a castle proportional to 1+n with n the number already chosen to go to that castle (""Bose stimulation"" so the occupancies behave as in a bosonic system of 100 particles in 10 wells).

Then I repeatedly held a tournament between my 1000 configurations, recording the best one and keeping the top half.  Each of the top half was kept once exactly and once ""mutated"" by randomly removing 1 soldier and putting him back in with the same (1+n) method, 100 times.  These were then the configurations used in the next round of the algorithm.
After 1000 tournaments, I had 1000 tournament winners.  I played a final tournament between these winning strategies, and submit the one which won that tournament.
The winners of ""normal"" tournaments are mostly of the form, with a few castles heavily fortified and several with less fortification.  But the winner of the ""tournament of champions"" is always of the form, with 28 points worth of castles heavily attacked and a few stray troops sent to other castles.  So this seems to be a strategy to use when the other strategies have been ""battle tested"" to at least some extent.

Others will take the full set of data and try to come up with something that will win the most matches given the previous round. Yet others might do an even deeper analysis going from there and try to reach some sort of Nash equilibrium based on everyone making the best decisions. But I feel like all of that might be overthinking it. Sort of as if we played rock-paper-scissors: if in the first round it turned out most people threw rock, then analysts might say ""you should throw paper to beat the typical throw!"" or ""you should throw scissors to beat the supposed winning strategy!"" But in reality it will just end up being random anyway.

An evenly spread player loses to me on all but castles 8 and 10, and a player who aims for the top loses even if they beat me in castles 8, 9, and 10. Aiming for castle 9 instead of 8 in this way makes the split with the 8-9-10 player 28/27 and also seems like the kind of twist needed to take this strategy to at least level 2, which may be as high as this rationally goes before it gets silly."

1,1,1,2,2,14,23,23,30,3,"To start off, it appears that for every castle, 30% of people did not send any troops there, so it makes sense to send a single troop to every castle. 

Secondly, if we win castles 9, 8, 7, and 6, then that's a total of 30 of the 55 points, so if I send a disproportionate amount of troops to those places and win those, there isn't enough points to overcome that. So after sending a base one to each, I divided the 90/4 and determined that I should send 22 more troops to each of the four castles.

Then I reasoned that Castle 6 was likely not going to as contested as the other three, so I took nine away from there and gave 7 to Castle 9 to make an even thirty. That gave me four more troops (two from the 6-9 distribution and two from the fact that 4 doesn't go into 90 cleanly). I figured I might as well give two of those to Castle 10 since almost half of everybody sent either 0, 1, or 2 troops and that's ten free points. The other troops I gave to castles 4 and 5 since if I somehow lose Castle 6 I can make up the points by winning either 4 or 5 if they employed the same basic strategy as I did and dished out one troop to each location"
