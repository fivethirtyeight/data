Also, looking at the distributions from last time, many people went with 0,1, or 2 troops at some relatively high value castles, so I set a minimum of 3 troops per castle to round up some cheap points- that fits with a strategy where you want to win a castle by having just one more troop than your opponent at a given castle.

Alternately, there are still the possibilities of people submitting the average number of troops (or similar, such as sending 0 or 1 to castle 10 and then the average * 1.2 to the remaining castles). So my strategy is focused on beating similar strategies as last time while not losing to the averages.I'm assuming the way people will try to adapt the strategy of the winner is to do one of the following: apply similar metrics but with different castles contested (sending 2 to high value noncontested castles, about 2 x Value troops to high value must-win castles, and about 1.5 x Value troops to low value castles); OR implement a strategy that strictly dominates the winner of last time. And some will still send in things similar to the average.My strategy is designed to win high value castles where neither of us are trying hard to win (sending 4 instead of 2 to castles 9 and 10, and 3 to castle 8). Where I contest must-win castles, I've added 2 to the winner from last time to beat out someone who adds 1 troop over the winner or applied a similar point multiple to the number of troops I'm sending (castles 4, 5, 6, 7). And castles 1 and 3 are contested with similar numbers of troops somewhere between the average and the winner from last time.In head to head matchups, this ties with the average number of troops and strictly dominates the winner and any strategies similar to the winner, unless they do something similar by sending more than 2 troops to high-value castles that they aren't contesting."4,8,16,20,6,6,4,17,4,15,"I focused on beating the previous winners' castles by small margins, and losing by large margins to castles people would think to invest highly in (i.e. 9, as the previous entries were quite low)"3,0,3,4,0,22,27,31,5,5,"You only need to win 28 battles so all castles won should at least add up to 28.Based upon previous data, 6, 7, 8 appear to be hotly contested while not having a strong plurality of ""1"" troops.
