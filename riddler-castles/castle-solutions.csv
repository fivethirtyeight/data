One way to do that would be to play minimally on all numbers except for 1. Then I take the ones they don't want, but I also steal castle 1, which is less sought after.

Of course, I lose to the ""10s all around"" strategy, which I imagine will also be popular.

Notice that the key is not beating a randomly generated opponent, but beating the most opponents, which means I want to be able to beat the most popular strategies. Hmm.

The method I've devised will beat ""10s all around"" and has a shot at beating folks who go all in on another strategy.

11,11,11,11,11,19,26,0,0,0,"I enjoyed this weekäó»s Riddler. I attacked it, not mathematically, but by brute force and trial näó» error. I learned that the best strategy would involve trying to win a few key battles (i.e. not all of them), loading to ensure victories in those battles, and that it would entail barely winning in the end; i.e. a small margin of victory. 

My first thought was to look at ways to lock up the highest-value castles. Winning the battles for the top 3 castles is 27 points, only 1 short of victory, so my approach involved throwing a lot of soldiers at the top 3, a chunk at a lower-value one, and deploying 1 soldier at the remaining ones (to win battles against zero soldiers). An example of this approach is 0-2-1-1-1-1-1-30-31-32. This wins against many strategies but fails against a simple one of 10-10-10-10-10-10-10-10-10-10. Loading up on one lower-value castle to 11 (to defeat that strategy) leads to too few soldiers at the higher-value castles.

Then I thought of the opposite approach; i.e. concede the battles for the 3 higher-value castles and try to win the remaining 7 (which would yield 28 points, and a win). The best approach I found was 11-11-11-11-11-19-26-0-0-0-. The 26 is necessary to defeat a strategy of deploying Œ_ of oneäó»s soldiers (i.e. 25) to each to the top 4 castles, the 11 is to beat the 10x10 strategy, and assigning the remaining 8 soldiers to the 5th highest castle.

This strategy works against almost every strategies, especially the ones that many people likely would choose. It fails against strategies involving loading up on the mid-value castles; e.g. 0-0-1-4-11-20-25-20-15-4. However, as those strategies lose to many other ones I thought people would not choose them."

I spent the last three soldiers in the 8,9,and 10 castles to win if there were no soldiers from the other side.

So, I chose to attack every castle with at least one, but to focus on the lowest seven for a win (1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28).  I threw one person on castles 8-10, so if they are left undefended I have a chance of picking off a high value one.  But I have 97 points distributed on the lowest value seven.

If they commit <3 per point they are targeting, I will win out on my targets.

In general, I will win over a given opponent if I tend to win castles by having only slightly more armies than my opponent, but lose castles by having much less than my opponent.

Castle 10 isn't worth fighting seriously for, but at the same time, other people might agree. In theory, my wide deployment will help against people who focus heavily on high numbers. However, I'd need to win all of 1-7 against someone who takes 8, 9, and 10. I send 6 people there - other people who don't focus seriously on 10 might send a token force, but they might recognize that 10 is worth dedicating a slightly stronger one.

I'm going to focus on taking 8 and bump it up to 40 soldiers, in hopes that that will take 8 away from more evenly spread distributions, and use the remaining 11 soldiers to bolster my 2s and 11s against people who are taking similar strategies, leaving me with 3.

No matter the strategy, people will focus their forces on the largest numbers they go for. Therefore it is best to stay away from 10 and 7. My strategy will then be to focus 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9 which overshoots 28 points but it is best to have backups. "
2,18,18,2,2,2,18,18,18,2,"I need to win 5 castles and get lucky to win.  I'm guessing people will either try and concentrate their forces on a few castles, in which case my 2 soldiers will win some, or they will spread all their troops out, in which case my 18 soldiers will win some."

2,16,6,15,2,11,21,5,1,21,"Adjusted random numbers. We could say there are three basic strategies (focus on a few high-value castles, focus on many low-value castles, and an even attack). Each of these strategies has an effective counter-strategy, but this naturally requires knowing the opponent's deployment. Random numbers are a form of an even attack, but the variance weakens the counter-strategy. The numbers were slightly adjusted to give advantage when facing an opponent who focused on the 10-9-8-7, without changing the outcome of an opponent who spread evenly."

Castles 9 and 10 are worth the most therefore they need the highest troop allocations, the rest were split between 2,3,4 evenly while leaving 2 in each remaining castle to win them if they are under defended. This strategy beats common strategies such as: 10 in each, 0,0,...0,25,25,25,25 and 2,4,5,7,9,11,13,15,16,18. Other than that it's mostly a guess at how other players will place their armies! "

And trade castle 7 for castles 3 and 4, which are equal in value (although I'm spreading across an additional castle).  

Using this strategy, I must win all my castles or the other person wins by default. But trying to win multiple ways is bad - pick a strategy and play it with all your might.  Other players that want to win with the 8 in the least number of castles will require 4 castles - they can't do it in 3.  Since winning with 4 castles requires at least a 9 or a 10, the 4 castle approach would rarely see that player put anything larger than 25 on the 8.  That's the basis for my going above 25 with my 8, but it's too complicated to reveal why I'm going with 36.

Well, it's topical.

There are 55 total points available. If one gets 28 he wins. If you put 3 on castle 1,  29 on 8, 32 on 9, and 36 on 10 you'll get there. You're allocating soldiers by castle points. 

But if you lose even the 1 castle, you lose.

Also, this strategy can be defeated by only 10 soldiers. 4 on castle 1, and 1 each on 2-7.

But it would beat my strategy. 

I went for efficiency. 1.8181... soldiers are available per point. If you allocate 14 soldiers to castle 8 there's virtually no waste of soldiers versus points. Approximately zero. It's efficient. 

But you have one soldier left. And where do you put him?

This is where it gets interesting. The best are, If I'm right, castles 10, 3, and 8.

In order, you're wasting 1 soldier for.555.... points for castle 10, or .6 soldiers for about 1 point for castle 3 and 8. 

But people like whole numbers up to six. Then they go for even numbers and multiples of 5. So adding the soldier to the 10 castle is probably not going to help. 

Also it's the least return. 

Between castles 3 and 8 I already have 5 soldiers attacking castle 3. But only 14 attacking castle 8. So I added the extra soldier there and thought that the worst that could happen is that I lose castle 3 and split castle 8 for a net gain of +1."

2,4,5,7,9,11,13,15,16,18,Big ballz
2,4,5,7,9,11,13,15,16,18,"Efficiency. 

There are 1.8181... soldiers available per castle point. 

And while the rules don't say that you can't cut up and part out soldiers, I'm assuming that you can't send .6 of one here and .4 there. 

So with my distribution except using 14 instead of 15 on castle 8, there is, on average, no waste. You waste (to one digit) .2 on 1, .4 on 2, .2 on 6, and .4 on 7. 

Then you underspend .4 on 3, .2 on 4, .4 on 8, and.2 on 9.

That's even. And only 99 soldiers. 

But for a minute let's consider the Electoral College approach. (Hey, it's topical.) There are 55 castle points available. 28 wins. So 3 on 1, 29 on 8, 32, on 9, and 36 on 10 is the most efficient to win 28 points. 

And beats my approach. 

But, interestingly, loses to only 10 soldiers. 4 on castle 1 and 1 soldier each for castles 2-7. The EC approach has to win EVERY castle it attacks. With even a tie it loses. 

So my question is what to do with my last lonely soldier? I've already overspent on castles 1,2,6, and 7. Those are out. I've underspent the same largest amount, .4, on castles 3 and 8. So adding my last soldier to one of those gives me the best benefit. But which one?

So now we get to the what is everyone else doing and how do people think territory. 

For 1-5 they use the number they need. For about 6-15 they use even numbers and multiples of 5. Someone might want 12 or 15 of something. Never 13. Or 17. 

Because you're getting into 15 or 20 territory now. 

And no one anywhere ever ordered  or bought 29 of anything. 

So adding to castle 3 moves me from 5-6. I'll take the probable draw because moving castle 8 to 15 soldiers even if I draw is more valuable.

2,4,5,5,3,3,4,4,32,38,"The deployment is based on a few key principles:

1. Have a set minimum number of troops for each castle
It pays to leave a few troops in each castle, even the lower valued ones. If an opponent leaves a castle empty (and it is likely that a decent chunk of opponents will do so in order to focus on higher-valued castles) then you can gain substantial points for a very small cost. The minimum is largely trial and error; I ended up with 3 as this was a good compromise between saving troops for larger castles and not getting easily defeated. I did not apply this minimum to Castle 1 as it would not be economic to do so - Castle 1 is worth so little that deploying more than 2 troops to it can quickly become a waste.

2. Fight hard for Castles 9 and 10
This should seem obvious, but if you can win both of these it makes your work a lot easier. On the other hand, if an opponent manages to beat you in these then they have barely any troops left, and thanks to your minimum you have a good chance of winning most of the rest.

2. Pay more attention to Castles 1-4 then 5-6
You can win Castles 1-4 fairly cheaply and get an easy 10 points. If you also win Castles 9 and 10 then you have easily won the war. On the other hand, if an opponent also focuses on 1-4, then the minimum should give you at least a few points in the middle. Combine with #2 and you have a decent shot.

3. Don't try to remain undefeated
No deployment is undefeatable. My deployment, for instance, loses to putting 10 soldiers in each castle, and also to the deployment 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19 (in Castles 1-10 respectively) which could be considered the ""mean"" deployment. Other submitters are unlikely to go with these deployments as they are overall quite weak - they are more likely to go with stronger options which nonetheless have vulnerabilities. One likely mistake is to heavily weight 3 Castles instead of 2 - you will not be able to put enough soldiers in each to beat a strong Castle 9 or 10, effectively wasting a larger amount of soldiers while also leaving less for the smaller castles. Remember, any path to victory requires at least 4 castles.

Through these principles and trial and error, I found this deployment to be the most successful, beating 22 other hypothetical deployments."
2,4,4,8,9,10,12,15,17,19,"Not knowing how my fellow Riddler readers will attack this problem, I went for the optimal strategy against a random distribution. The ideal ratio of troops each to point is 1.8181... . I believe my distribution comes as close as possible to achieving that, as measured by the average of castle-by-castle ratios. We'll see how it goes!"
2,4,4,4,4,10,18,20,22,12,"I've played this before! In the past I've seen that 4 is usually enough to contest the lower castles, while committing too much to castle 10 is often a mistake, especially among groups still new to the game."

Or going for all the top castles (25 each on 10, 9, 8, x) which I would prevent by winning castle 9. I was initially going to go for all of the lower castles, (7 and below) but that would lose whenever someone spent big on 10, 9, 8, and a random one. My goal here is to win castle 9 almost always, 7 almost always, and usually 6, 5, and 3 without conceding any other castles. Winning these castles would provide 30 points and a win. Losing one of them could be made up if someone sent zero soldiers to castles to some of the other castles.

This left me with 1 remaining troop for castle 7, as placing 9 troops seems quite inefficient in a game where you expect a lot of 10s. Looking over my answer, it felt a little crazy spending 35 troops on castle 10, so I bumped it down to 34 and placed that remaining troop again in castle 7 so I could beat the 10s instead of tie."

I also kinda feel like there's not much difference between 13 to 19, but 20, 21, and 22 armies are each more likely to win."

But to ensure my own victory without having to divide my own forces too thin, I need at least one of them.  The 8, as the smallest trophy, makes a logical frontal point of attack, and I have sent enough troops to beat anyone who sends up to a third of their force there.

I first selected a random number from 1 to 10. This would be the first castle I would deploy troops to. I selected a random number from 0 to 100 to determine the number of troops. Then I selected another number from 1 to 10. If it was the same as the first draw, I drew again. Then selected the number of troops to send between 0 and 100 less the number at the first castle. Repeat this until all castles have been assigned troops. This produced a lot of identical deployments, which made me question the randomness of this. After further thought, I should chosen the second castle with a random number from 1 to 9. But because I'm up against a deadline, I don't have the time to develop truly random deployments. I can still glean some insights from my faux random deployments.

I got about 10,000 unique deployments and ran them against each other - round robin style. I added in a few of my own (e.g. even distribution, weighted high, weighted low, etc.) I gave 1 point for a win, 0 for a loss and 0.5 for a tie. 

The winning deployment earned 9,663.5 points and was one of my chosen strategies. This beat out the next best strategy (a random one) by almost 40 points.

Given I can no longer distribute proportionally, I took the troops away from castles 4 and 5, hoping my counterpart will attack aggressively on those castles, or not at all.

I decided the best course of action would be to optimize over the win/loss rate of a strategy against a set of random possible opposing strategies.  So I booted up R and ran a simulated annealing algorithm to create a strategy that seemed to win a lot.  That failed horribly because the set of all opposing strategies is enormous.  

So instead of trying out random opposing sets, I tried to create a smaller set of ""plausible"" opposing strategies (repeated or nearly-repeated values in 3-10 slots making up the bulk of the allocation, with random allocation to all other slots).  I found a strategy that was robust to my changing various parameters of my ""plausible strategy"" set, and decided to submit that (win rate in my simulator is about 87% across plausible-strategy perturbations).

Towers 8-10 leave you one point short, so you can try to take the #7 or drop all the way to trying to sneak the #1. You can try to abandon the high numbers and just take #1-7. I thought of some sneaky in between answers, like taking towers #4-8. Generally the top heavy strategies worked well. Any strategy that focused more troops on the bigger towers did better than those that divvied out the troops equally.

This final strategy of focusing on the even towers ended up winning the mini battle-royale. I suppose the point is to win the 10, while conceding the 9, win the 8 , while conceding the seven, and so on, netting just enough points to win with a little room to spare. I made sure to get at least one troop to each tower to sneak wins against folks who focus too heavily. I massaged some of the totals to keep them above any product of 5 (11, 21, 26...).

However, I found that an opponent that put 10 on each would win against this strategy.  I considered a strategy that would win me castles 1 through 7 (also totaling 28 points) but that started spreading my troops too thin making it likely that an opponent would place more than me on just one castle which would cause me to lose.  I started to realize that it is not wise to put zero soldiers at a castle; even putting just one soldier at a castle could help me win in cases where my opponent left castles unattended (which I figured would happen often).  However, I figured many people might realize this as well so I wanted to put two on such a castle if possible.  I also figured that many opponents would go for castle 10, since it is the highest valued, so I shifted my strategy to lower castles.

I looked at optimal strategies for smaller versions of the game.  For 9 soldiers and 3 castles, [0,0,9] is an optimal strategy.  For 16 soldiers and 4 castles it is already difficult to find an exact solution.  Solving it approximately by using the fictitious play method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_play), shows higher coefficients placed on strategies with more soldiers on the higher points castles, but not all on the highest point castle.  This makes intuitive sense because the higher points castles are more valuable, but you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket because the other castles combined are worth more than any one castle.

Therefore I chose a strategy where deployments to each castle were approximately proportional to the point value of the castle.  This is as reasonable a strategy as any, given that no pure strategy is optimal."

Second, I'm guessing that most contestants will pour a lot of resources into Castle 10, and that Castle 10 will receive a disproportionate share of most defense. By essentially forfeiting Castle 10, I can reallocate those resources to winning Castles 7-9, which make up almost 44% of the points available and means I only need to win 4 other points somewhere else. Under the assumption that I either win all 3 of those, I only need to win 4, 5, 6 or 2 and 3 to win; under the assumption that I win 2/3 of Castles 7-9, then I need to win Castles 4-6 or 2/3 of those and both of Castles 2-3. But unless the opponent only sent a small number of soldiers to Castle 10, they won't be able to effectively contest all of the remaining castles and still win one of Castles 7-9 (unless they only sent 0 or 1 soldiers to the ones they lost, in which case their strategy effectively counters mine).

I'm hoping that this will generally dominate the strategy of ""30 or more to Castle 10, 15-24 to Castles 7-9, almost nothing to the remaining castles"" as well as the strategy of proportional distribution based on point value (18 to Castle 10, 16 to 9, 15 to 8, 13 to 7, 11 to 6, etc)."

Smaller scale simulations (up to 40 soldiers in 5 or 6 castles)showed little advantage for the low-value castles, while there were much better wining percentages (with a flatter distribution of soldiers) with the higher-value castles.

I divided my remaining 94 soldiers into the castles I was targeting by proportion of points they were worth. I made a few adjustments to that in order to try to exploit strategies which divided proportionally (and to avoid similar exploitation myself).

1,1,1,2,2,6,26,26,19,16,Since you need at least 28 points to win the war to win with the minimum number of castles you need to win 4 castles all of which are 6 points or higher. Knowing that distributed troops to beat most deployments that split troops evenly across 4 castles as well as to beat other potentially common distributions. Put some troops in lower value castles to try to reduce likelihood of splitting points in those areas reducing the likelihood of losing one higher point castle leading to losing the war.
1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,42,45,"The Monarch of Riddler Nation will be the player who wins the most match-ups - only victory and defeat matter, not average scores. A winning strategy will be one that maximizes the number of (often very narrow) victories.

Therefore, one could do very well by concentrating all troops evenly among any combination of four castles (25 soldiers per castle) that together yield 28 or more victory points. There are 27 such combinations, all of which win against anyone who tries to spread troops more thinly among all 10 castles (e.g. [1,1,1,1,1,1,23,23,24,24]). The dominant strategy among these is [0,0,0,0,0,0,25,25,25,25], which defeats any other 4 x 25 combination (e.g. [0,0,0,25,0,25,0,25,0,25]).

I think enough people will start with a variation on 4 x 25 that it is the strategy to beat. The only successful counter involves piling more than 25 soldiers into a single castle, at the expense of potentially conceding another castle. How does one beat [0,0,0,0,0,0,25,25,25,25]? Easy! [0,0,0,0,0,0,24,25,25,26]!
Or better yet, [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,33,33,34]! And how does one beat that? [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,50]! But wait, that could be defeated by [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100]!

If we take this to its logical extreme, the equilibrium strategy is to pile all soldiers into the highest value castle. This is because any strategy contesting a certain set of castles can be outdone by another that contests the most valuable of these castles *harder* at the expense of any single less valuable castle.

However, will this actually be successful in reality? I highly doubt it. An iterated series of matches between two opponents might very well result in this strategy being used, if only for a brief moment. Opponents stack troops in the 4 most important castles until one realizes targeting only the top 3 is even better, and so on until only the 10 victory point castle is contested. But this strategy would immediately be handily beaten (45-10) in the next round by an opponent who suddenly decides to send soldiers to all castles again.

Just like in the Keynesian Beauty Contest problem, most players will not take this game to its logical extreme. Here, anyone who contests only castle 10 will probably lose the vast majority of their contests. They will only beat those who contest a set of other castles with a combined value less than 10, which I think will be rather rare.

I think it's quite likely that most contestants will invest heavily in 3 or 4 castles. Stacking an absurd amount of soldiers in castles 9 and 10 can defeat most such strategies by snatching 19 victory points right off the bat, with hopefully enough VP coming to me from ties or narrow victories at lower VP castles.

This leaves me very vulnerable to very basic strategies (e.g. 10 soldiers per castle, or random placement) or to those that stack a minimum of 3 or 4 soldiers per castle, but I am hoping the presumed preponderance of 4 x 25 type strategies will scare people off from these types of even spreads.

Castle 10 is an obvious ""honeypot"", so I'll avoid concentrating there. Castle 7 is the overlap between the needed ""high castles"" (7-10) and ""low castles"" (1-7).

1,1,1,1,16,19,1,28,31,1,"Victory requires 28 points, which requires a minimum of 4 castles. The sum of any castle and the 3 above it exceeds 28 points beginning at castle 6 (6,7,8,9), and then by 2 points.

Weighting troop commitment by point value yields 18,21,29,32 for castles 5,6,8,9. In this case all castles are must win, one victory condition. Risking castles by diverting 6 troops (2 each from 5,6 and 1 from 8,9) picks up any remaining castle where no troops were committed by the opponent, laying claim to any of the remaining 27 points that might compensate for a tie or loss in the big 4. If the enemy also sends a token troop to every castle I still gain 13.5 points, within half a point of compensating for the total loss of any two of my must-win castles except for both 8 and 9. The solution is not rigorously tested, but it provides ubiquitous coverage while focusing maximum troop strength on the easiest targets necessary."
1,1,1,1,15,19,23,1,1,37,"If you want to win, you must acquire 28 or more points. This requires that you should spend approximately 3.57 units per point that you wish to acquire. Regardless of choice, each castle should have at least 1 unit assigned so to capture castles that the other player does not find interesting for their win strategy. 

My choices were based on the competition for 10, 9 and 8. I found that 10 is probably the most cost effective castle to win, but will also be heavily contested. Most would allocate either way too many points to this castle and leave others unguarded, or would allocate less than the optimal rate (rounded up) + 1. 9 and 8 are also essential to victory for a minimum castle set (4 castles, adding up to 28 or more), but without 10, require 2 more castles. I decided to avoid 8 and 9 based on the fact that if they wanted 10, they might also want 8 and 9. So instead, I focused my troops on  5, 6 and 7 to achieve my minimum of 28. 

I assumed that other players would either ignore the castles they did not want, in favor of the castles they did want, or they would allocate a minimum of 1 troop as well, in which there would be no point advantage to the castles they did not want. If only 1 troop is allocated to castles with little value to the strategy, then you have a maximum amount of troops to allocate to the 4 castles that you intend to take. "

By playing 1 in each castle, this will also pick up points against other overloaded strategies that are likely to send 0. Castle 9 is set to be larger than 1/3 to beat heavily overloaded strategies, though it might be better to play it completely proportionally (17, 20, 27, 30 instead of 15, 19, 26, 34)

There are lots of ways to getting to 28.1+2+3+...+6=21 so you need at least castle 7 to win. This also means you are guaranteed to win with 7 castles. 10+9+8=27, so you need to win at least 4 castles as well. If you are only going to use 4 castles, you need castle 9 and/or castle 10 because 8+7+6+5=26.

My first strategy was to have at least one soldier go to each castle. That way if my opponent decides to only attack 4 castles, I am guaranteed 6.

My second strategy was to try to win with only 4 castles.  Since you need either castle 9 or 10, I figured they would be the most desired and soldiers would be sent accordingly. So instead of guarding both,  I decided to pick one. I decided to go with castle 9 and not 10. After that,  my options if I wanted only 4 castles were either castles 4, 7, 8, and 9 or castles 5, 6, 8, and 9. I went with the latter so I wouldn't have to win 7, 8, and 9.

Once I chose my 4 castles, I had 90 soldiers left to play with and sent them by weight.  40 more to castle 9, 30 more to castle 8, and 10 more to both castles 5 and 6. I put 10 more in those csdtles, in case someone just put 10 in each castle."

One needs to capture a minimum of 4 castles to achieve this, so this caused me to focus my troops on the four castles that would in my mind be most effective in achieving this. 

By giving up castle 10, it does not make any sense to pursue castles 1-4: their values are equal and it would be a waste of troops to capture one only for the other to offset the gain. To me, the only castles that matter are 5-9. Thus, I deployed troops in the way to most likely take the higher value targets while also hopefully overpowering the lower priority castles with troops gained by sending the bare minimum to half of the castles.

Also, the marginal value of 1 troop is so low that sending one to a castle on the chance that no other troops are sent seems to make sense."

I remove some from 6, allocating a few extra to the high end and one to each of the low five, so to beat strategies that place zero on many castles.

General design: started with 10,000 randomly allocated rows allocating soldiers in groups of 5 (to get improved clustering), plus ten seed rows, including 100 in castle 10, 50/50, 10/30/30/30, 25/25/25/25, 20/20/20/20/20, and 16/16/17/17/17/17 (castle 10 always the last number) and several others.  Simulated all deployments battling all others, then tallied wins, and created a new sample of 20k rows using PPS with replacement sampling based on the square of wins.  Reran the simulated battles, then did another sample selection step with 25k rows again using PPS, and reran those simulated battles.  The winner was 19/19/20/21/21 which won 23,812 battles out of 25,000.

I also confirmed the results using a OLS regression with the ten castle quantities as independent variables and wins as the dependent variable.  OLS indicates that castles 7 through 10 have positive coefficients, 6 has approximately 0 coefficient, and 1-5 have negative coefficients, suggesting that more tests might pull towards a higher number for castle 9 and 10.  Given the slightly negative (but nearly zero) weight on 6, I felt confident removing some of the armies from it in order to put single armies on the other five."

I have been considering 3 broad classes of strategy.  (Obviously there are deployments which don't fit into this schema, but which may still be meritorious.) I call these classes Paper, Scissors and Stone.

Paper strategies cover all the castles with forces approximately proportional to the value of the castle, for example (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,  13, 15, 17, 19).  I also consider an equal distribution of forces, 10 to each castle, to be a Paper deployment.

Scissors surgically target a winning subset of castles, for example (10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 30, 30,. 30).  Clearly Scissors will defeat paper.

Stone strategies target subset of castles insufficient to win on their own, but additionally hope to win or tie enough other castles to gain the extra points to win the war. (1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 32, 32, 32) is a stone strategy.  It will win if it wins castles 8, 9, and 10 and either wins castle 1 or ties any other castle.

Stone loses to paper (it wins its targeted castles but loses the rest).  It mostly wins against scissors because both strategies are likely to contest at least one high-value castle, and stone's forces will be more concentrated.

It's my expectation that the majority of depoyments submitted will be Scissors or paper-scissors hybrids.  My original idea was the stone (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 33, 33, 33)  This is elegant in that it wins precisely when it wins castles 8, 9, and 10, and any other castle is uncontested by the opponent.  The first condition is nearly certain against a scissor strategy since these must target at least four castles, and it will be very difficult to commit as many as 33 soldiers to any one of them.  The second condition is much less certain.  I cannot predict how many competitors will decide to contest every castle.

I decided to tweak my original idea as I suspect that rather more scissor players will put at least one soldier into every castle than will put exactly 32 into one of 8, 9,  and 10.  I consider it unlikely that a scissor strategy would put more than 1 soldier into castles 2, 3, and 4, without also commuting similar or greater forces to castles 5, 6, and 7.  If he does that, it's not really a pure scissor, more a paper-scissors hybrid."

My feeling is that most of the analytical riddler minds will modify proportional distribution, giving slight edges to certain castles to try to win them by slight margins, as this seems like the optimal plan. So let's turn that on it's head, and beat a lot of people who smoothly allocate their points. 

There are 55 total points, so 23 total points win. There are many ways to get this with only three castles, but let's keep in mind people will tend to try to do sneaky things to steal high number castles (particularly #9, as that seems ""sneaky"" to ignore 10 and steal 9). 

My first reaction was: just win 7,8,9. Put all your points in and win those. This gives 24 and a sure win. But again, 9 seems like a very highly contested castle. So I decided instead, 6,7,8,2. Surely 2 and 6 should be more guaranteed than 9!

Now just how to distribute. Well, I should mirror how others will be distributing their points here. (obviously 25 troops to each could lose me 7,8 somewhat frequently). While it seems like I MUST win all four to win, many people will likely assign 0 to some castles, so tie points may come into effect. So even losing 6 can be repaired by a tie in 10 and 3.  So I aim to get 23 total points, so let's assign proportionally:

{0,2/23*100, 0,0,0,6/23*100, 7/23*100, 8/23*100, 0, 0} = {0,9,0,0,0,26,30,35,0,0}.

Objective: Conquer the kingdom.

The total value of the castles is 55. The total victory points needed to win is 28, assuming no ties. The first thing to do is to establish the minimum number of ways to reach the winning number, given some assumptions and assessing potential strategies.  

I had to be careful that my strategy could not lose to an even distribution, and I assumed that everyone else would take the same precautions. Now, I wouldn't have to worry about other strategys that would lose to 10 troops at each castle, 20 trooops at 5 castles, etc. What I did need to worry about were more developed strategies like a bell distribution and whether or not people would put more than a third of their troops on one castle to secure a victory. 

Initially, I believed that giving up free castles was a poor strategy, so I started with the idea that a troop must be sent to each castle. That most players would send most of their troops to castle #10 was an assumption I kept. Assessing the average of winning #8 and #9 was as good as winning #7 and #10, I decided to lose the a few battles, and win the war. 

After many campaigns, I had a lot of rock/paper/scissors where one of my strategies would lose to one that didn't follow assumptions, but that one would lose to a more deliberate bell-curve or even spread. I decided to remove the requirement of challenging each castle, and kept optimizing, while ensuring they were safe from easily preventable defeats. "

So, we expect most strategies to rely on two or more of the top three castles plus two others (25,0,25,0,25,0,25,0,0,0). The available approaches to beat these baseline strategies are:
1) Claim two of those three with overwhelming strength and pick two more with sufficient strength to pick them up against token support (0,37,37,0,13,13,0,0,0,)
2) Figure that almost everyone wants to use either the 9-point castle or the 10-point castle and overload that, then spread the rest fairly widely expecting to pick up the holes in the opponent's broken strategy (1,51,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0)
3) Execute the strategy more or less directly, trying to claim three of the top four with strength, then choosing a fourth castle to claim with less than overwhelming support. (1,26,26,26,1,17,1,1,1,0)
4) Pick a strategy that requires winning five castles that do not include the top two. (1,1,41,14,14,1,14,14,0,0)
Of these, the third seems the weakest--the others break it. Counterintuitively, the fourth strategy is the most successful.

1) It should deploy troops in proportion to the number of points to be won

3) It should be robust against opponents who make small deviations from the same strategy
4) It should beat every obvious strategy

There are 55 points available but only 28 points are required to win. Therefore, most of the troops are concentrated on winning castles 8, 9 and 10, for which 27 points are available.

The remainder of the troops are concentrated on trying to win castle 3, rather than trying to win castle 7. This is because castle 7 will be more competitive than castle 3, and deploying a proportionate number of troops to win castle 7 will be a waste of resources which could be used to fight for the other castles.

This strategy is robust against another strategy which leaves a lot of the smaller castles undefended. Even if it lost castle 9 or castle 10 to such an opponent, it would still win because of the split points at the castles ignored by both sides.

It would lose to a strategy which attempted to win castle 1 rather than castle 3 but it has an advantage over the latter strategy in that it would beat the ""obvious"" strategy of putting 10 troops on each castle, while the latter strategy would not."

A ""wide"" strategy that contests all 10 castles (55 points, avg 1.81 men-per-point) will always lose to a ""tall"" strategy that contests barely enough castles to win (28 points, avg 3.57 men-per-point). With a nearly 2-to-1 advantage in men per point, the ""tall"" build has a lot of wiggle room for differences in castle distribution where it can still win.

A ""tall"" strategy will lose to a ""focused"" strategy that sends an unusual # of men to one or two castles (not enough to win by themselves) and then small #s of men to all remaining castles... but only if the ""focused"" player picks exactly the right castles. For example, a ""1-8-9-10"" tall player will lose to a focused-wide player that sends 54 men to castle 9 and 1 man-per-point to all other castles.

However, a ""focused"" build loses horribly to any ""wide"" build... and even to some ""tall"" builds. (for example, 9-focused versus 4-7-8-10 tall) Therefore, ""tall"" is the strongest overall strategy as it is only soft-countered by ""focused"".

When considering ""tall"" vs. ""tall"" fights... you're going to overlap on at least a few points. By definition if you win all of the overlap points, you'll have at least 28 victory points and you will win. So it is more important to contest the points you've chosen than to send single lonely soldiers to win uncontested points - you should go all-in on the limited # of castles you have.

Tall builds will be more likely to involve the higher numbers (8,9,10) than the lower numbers (you need all of castles 1-7 to win) so you should send greater-than-average men-per-point to the high numbers."

I then considered a value based model where each ith castle received (i/55)*100 troops so that 10 'value points' would be defended by the same number of troops whether they were all associated w/ one castle, or spread out among several. I used a monte carlo algorithm to benchmark both methods, testing each model against tens of thousands of randomized troop assignments. The value based model proved superior by a wide margin, but given how naive of a solution it was, I felt it wouldn't fare well against the majority of solutions. I noticed however that moving a single troop from the first castle to the tenth gave an assignment that beat this solution. This assignment however, could be outclassed in the same way. 

Thinking about the problem a little more, I realized only 28 points are needed to win, so I considered all or nothing strategies that heavily targeted just 4 castles with values adding up to 28. These solutions however, were the worst ones I'd come up w/ yet as losing just one of the 4 castles would guarantee failure against a typical assignment.

Intuitively, it was clear that 'clumping' was easily countered by more uniform troop distributions, but my benchmarking showed that the naive value-based model I came up with initially was worse than an augmented version of that model to a slight but statistically significant degree. Since the value based model was far better than the naive clumping approach, I decided to use that model as the basis for more monte carlo shenanigans. Starting w/ the value based model,
I generated random augmentations of a seed set of models . These augmented models differed by one to two troops assignments, and were benchmarked against randomized assignments like their predecessors. I would then collect the best models from one generation and use them as the seed set for the next generation. Eventually, I obtained a lot of models that look like the one I submitted, the submitted model being the best model in the last generation of assignments I produced. 

Looking back on my approach, I am optimistic about how this model would fare in competition. It looks a lot like the naive value based solution, but just a little bit better. I would hope my troop assignment would run into my value based solution a lot during the evaluation process, yet I have a few hangs ups. For one, I wonder if a clumping approach could work just by virtue of people playing fair. I imagine many people would submit well thought out solutions that might look a lot like my solution above. While my solution beats an estimated 95% of possible troop assignments, a clumping solution like [0,0,0,0,0,25,25,25,25,0] would beat my solution and others like it, while only beating an estimated 30% of solutions in general. Similarly, by benchmarking against random assignments, I may have included many extraneous strategies. Despite this, I don't feel fit to judge how motivated or clever other riddle enthusiasts are, so I'll stick to the result that took the longest to produce.

Also the minimum number of castles you need to get 23 points is 3 so you shouldn't waste troops fighting over a large amount of castles but focus on winning a few key ones.
After getting that far in my thought process I couldn't decide what I should do, so I wrote a simple simulation to find interesting strategies for me. It randomly generates several thousands strategies and makes them fight in the same way you will be judging the contest. After that they are ranked by how many victories they achieved and then the losing half is removed and replaced by new strategies generated by randomly modifying ones in the winning half. This causes strategies to evolve over time. Strategies would rise up and start dominating the simulation then eventually be bested and move down to the losing half and disappear.
The strategy I chose was one that I hadn't though of but my simulation did, so I'm hoping not many other people will have thought of it. It dominated the simulation for a decent amount of time when I didn't expect it to. It focuses on winning castles 9 and 10 and hedges its bets between 4 and 5.

My thinking has not changed all that much. I still think that a proportionate strategy is best but that it is also a good idea to aim for enough points to win, rather than all of the points. I also think that a strategy needs to be robust against similar strategies and to defeat all obvious strategies.

My concern, however, is that an opponent who anticipates the popularity of a proportionate strategy could exploit this by making their strategy slightly less proportionate, for example by overloading castle 10 at the expense of one of the other castles. This would defeat a proportionate strategy which targeted the same castles.

The best way to counter this is to not target castle 10 at all, and to let those smart alecs waste their resources.

Therefore, my strategy is now an almost-proportionate 28 point strategy, focusing on castles 4, 7, 8, 9. It is only non-proportionate to the extent that it takes 3 troops away from castle 4, and adds one to each of castles 7, 8 and 9.

I have done no computer simulations - this is all in my head - but as far as I can see, it will do very well against almost every opponent.

It will defeat every fully proportionate strategy and every non-proportionate strategy in which the emphasis is on overloading castle 10.

It will also defeat a flat strategy, in which 10 troops are allocated to each castle, or 25 troops are allocated to each of four different castles."

Between the two, [9, 8, 7, 4] just seemed a little more consistent to me. I think a reasonable player might commit 15 or more soldiers to Castles #5 and #6, so it might be more  of a guessing game. But 11 soldiers will almost certainly win Castle #4."

0,0,0,1,5,6,16,19,26,27,"Two things to note before going to the computation method. Firstly, the deployment 10-tuple should be weakly increasing; it makes no sense to devote more men to a less valuable castle. Secondly, there is no single deployment that beats all others. To see this, observe that (0, ..., 0, 100) is not best, as it is beaten by (0, ..., 0, 50, 50, 0). For any deployment other than (0, ..., 0, 100), take the first castle to be assigned a number of soldiers >0, and move one of them to the next (higher value) castle. This slightly modified deployment will win. [As the set of possible deployments is finite and ""beats or ties"" is 'total', we can see that ""beats or ties"" is not an ordering relation.]

This means that we're not trying to find (or approximate) the 'top' deployment, as there isn't one. Rather, we're trying to find the deployment that will beat the majority of submissions. As a first guess, let's randomly generate a bunch of (weakly increasing) deployments [more on that below], and see which ones beat the most of the other ones we generated. We might be tempted to just see which one gets the highest winning percentage and put that one in. But, we're not trying to get the highest winning percentage against random deployments, but rather against submitted deployments. So, we want to see which deployments work best against ""good candidates"" (assuming that's what people will submit).

We do this iteratively. Generate a whole bunch. Send the top half through to the next round. Then play that top half against each other, and send the top half of that round's competition through to the next round after that (irregardless of how well they did in the previous round; like Masterchef, unlike Hell's Kitchen, for any fellow Gordon Ramsey enthusiasts out there). At each iteration we get a better version of ""see how they do against 'good' candidates.""

My submission was the best after 10 rounds of this. I'm sure more rounds would give a better submission, but we'll see how this does.

Finally, the messy details about how I made random weakly increasing deployments.  I generated 10 random independent samplings of the Unif(0,1) distribution. I then scaled them all so as they summed to 100, rounded each of them down to the nearest integer, and added whatever I needed to the last sample to make them sum to 100.  Then, I sorted them, assigning the lowest integer to the least valuable castle, etc."

Strategy B is going all in on just 28 points worth of castles. Something like 40 on Castle 10, 28 on Castle 8, 19 on Castle 6, and 13 on Castle 4. There is little room for error with Strategy B, as losing just 1 of your targets guarantees a loss, but the big advantage here is that all soldiers are warring at the required castles and none are wasted.
I need to figure out a way to beat both of these strategies consistently ---- if I can, I figure I will win enough wars against these two to ignore any other strategies (strategies geared to beat these 2, strategies geared to beat mine, or other ""optimal if both are playing completely logically"" strategies I cannot come up with.) My first idea is to concede Castle 10, giving me more soldiers to play with in the rest of the 9 castles and hopefully proving to be a key advantage going forward. If I was to then proportion my soldiers out similar to Strategy A, but just on the back 9, I would clean up house against Strategy A. However, this will usually doom me against Strategy B. There are so many alterations of Strategy B: 10+9+8+1, 10+9+7+2, 10+9+6+3...39 different ones by my count. Moreover, each castle shows up in 19 to 20 of these different strategies.

Still wanting to avoid the assumed-to-be-hotly-contested 10 castle, and noting that all but one contain either a 9 or an 8, I am going to choose my own 4-castle, 28-point strategy that is front-loaded on 9 and 8: 9 + 8 + 6 + 5. Lastly, I chose my distribution of soldiers using a Price is Right-esque strategy, going just over multiples of 5 to hopefully avoid tying with the most common answers.

There are 55 points possible, so one needs to score 28 points to win. Since the biggest score with just 3 castles is 10+9+8=27<28, any solution needs to dominate four castles. 

I'm guessing that most people will try to conquer 10 -- so I don't want to dominate that castle. This is just spreading my troops among the next four castles in a fashion that I hope works well.

Putting these two together I decided to amass my troops at four castles This is the smallest number of castles that can ensure you get more than half the available points.  Doing so at Castles 6-9 hopefully gives me an advantage over people that expend troops on Castle 10.

So it seems wise to concentrate troops on four castles that together can take the prize. I figure 10 will be in high demand so I concentrate on 6-9, which together combine for 30 points, more than the 28 points needed to win. 

I put together a program with my son that simulates lots of tournaments of randomly selected deployments and outputs the average of the winners. I was surprised to see a pattern emerge, proving there is some merit to my earlier analysis. Winners tended to put lots of troops in 6, 7, 8, and 9, but fewer in 10. 

I then picked a deployment similar to my final answer and ran it head-to-head against a million random selections, and carefully tweaked it, moving one soldier at a time to find the best possible strategies.  I'm not sure there aren't better strategies -- this may be a local maximum -- but it's good enough. Also, the best strategy really depends on how others play the game. This one does pretty well against soldiers deployed randomly (and another algorithm that assigns soldiers randomly with a  preference for the higher valued castles), but it may not be the best against strategies that are actually employed in this game.
