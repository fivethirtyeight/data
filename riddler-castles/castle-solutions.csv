I learned that the best strategy would involve trying to win a few key battles (i.e. not all of them), loading to ensure victories in those battles, and that it would entail barely winning in the end; i.e. a small margin of victory. My first thought was to look at ways to lock up the highest-value castles. Winning the battles for the top 3 castles is 27 points, only 1 short of victory, so my approach involved throwing a lot of soldiers at the top 3, a chunk at a lower-value one, and deploying 1 soldier at the remaining ones (to win battles against zero soldiers). An example of this approach is 0-2-1-1-1-1-1-30-31-32. This wins against many strategies but fails against a simple one of 10-10-10-10-10-10-10-10-10-10. Loading up on one lower-value castle to 11 (to defeat that strategy) leads to too few soldiers at the higher-value castles.Then I thought of the opposite approach; i.e. concede the battles for the 3 higher-value castles and try to win the remaining 7 (which would yield 28 points, and a win). The best approach I found was 11-11-11-11-11-19-26-0-0-0-. The 26 is necessary to defeat a strategy of deploying å_ of one‰Ûªs soldiers (i.e. 25) to each to the top 4 castles, the 11 is to beat the 10x10 strategy, and assigning the remaining 8 soldiers to the 5th highest castle.This strategy works against almost every strategies, especially the ones that many people likely would choose. It fails against strategies involving loading up on the mid-value castles; e.g. 0-0-1-4-11-20-25-20-15-4. However, as those strategies lose to many other ones I thought people would not choose them."

5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14,15,"It's a bit of a weighted average.  I first deployed 1-10 soldiers based on point values, one to Castle 1, two to Castle 2, et cetera.  That left 45 soldiers.  I then distributed the rest evenly, sending 4 more soldiers to each castle, and then sending the last 5 to the top 5 castles.  I figure some adversaries will be more top-heavy, and this way I might win some of the middle and lower castles and make it a close contest.  This distribution would also beat those who went for a pure average 10-man-per-castle deployment."

Proportional allocation would be 36,32,28 and 4 (sum is 100)."

As for which of the many combinations adding up to 28 I selected?

I spent the last three soldiers in the 8,9,and 10 castles to win if there were no soldiers from the other side.

But, those strategies leave vulnerable the other castles for picking by a sole attacker.So, I chose to attack every castle with at least one, but to focus on the lowest seven for a win (1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28).  I threw one person on castles 8-10, so if they are left undefended I have a chance of picking off a high value one.  But I have 97 points distributed on the lowest value seven.It can be beat, but not by the first several options in game theory.Like the quick question about 2/3rds of the average guess, there is no theoretical right answer.

Or 17. Because you're getting into 15 or 20 territory now. And no one anywhere ever ordered  or bought 29 of anything. So adding to castle 3 moves me from 5-6. I'll take the probable draw because moving castle 8 to 15 soldiers even if I draw is more valuable. And moving castle 9 or 10 from 16 and 18 probably won't make a difference. "

2,4,5,5,3,3,4,4,32,38,"The deployment is based on a few key principles:1. Have a set minimum number of troops for each castleIt pays to leave a few troops in each castle, even the lower valued ones. If an opponent leaves a castle empty (and it is likely that a decent chunk of opponents will do so in order to focus on higher-valued castles) then you can gain substantial points for a very small cost. The minimum is largely trial and error; I ended up with 3 as this was a good compromise between saving troops for larger castles and not getting easily defeated. I did not apply this minimum to Castle 1 as it would not be economic to do so - Castle 1 is worth so little that deploying more than 2 troops to it can quickly become a waste.2. Fight hard for Castles 9 and 10This should seem obvious, but if you can win both of these it makes your work a lot easier. On the other hand, if an opponent manages to beat you in these then they have barely any troops left, and thanks to your minimum you have a good chance of winning most of the rest.2. Pay more attention to Castles 1-4 then 5-6You can win Castles 1-4 fairly cheaply and get an easy 10 points. If you also win Castles 9 and 10 then you have easily won the war. On the other hand, if an opponent also focuses on 1-4, then the minimum should give you at least a few points in the middle. Combine with #2 and you have a decent shot.3. Don't try to remain undefeatedNo deployment is undefeatable. My deployment, for instance, loses to putting 10 soldiers in each castle, and also to the deployment 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19 (in Castles 1-10 respectively) which could be considered the ""mean"" deployment. Other submitters are unlikely to go with these deployments as they are overall quite weak - they are more likely to go with stronger options which nonetheless have vulnerabilities. One likely mistake is to heavily weight 3 Castles instead of 2 - you will not be able to put enough soldiers in each to beat a strong Castle 9 or 10, effectively wasting a larger amount of soldiers while also leaving less for the smaller castles. Remember, any path to victory requires at least 4 castles.Through these principles and trial and error, I found this deployment to be the most successful, beating 22 other hypothetical deployments."

My goal here is to win castle 9 almost always, 7 almost always, and usually 6, 5, and 3 without conceding any other castles. Winning these castles would provide 30 points and a win.

This left me with 1 remaining troop for castle 7, as placing 9 troops seems quite inefficient in a game where you expect a lot of 10s.

Then selected the number of troops to send between 0 and 100 less the number at the first castle. Repeat this until all castles have been assigned troops. This produced a lot of identical deployments, which made me question the randomness of this. After further thought, I should chosen the second castle with a random number from 1 to 9.

I added in a few of my own (e.g. even distribution, weighted high, weighted low, etc.) I gave 1 point for a win, 0 for a loss and 0.5 for a tie. The winning deployment earned 9,663.5 points and was one of my chosen strategies. This beat out the next best strategy (a random one) by almost 40 points. Honestly, I'm disappointed in this answer. I was hoping that one of the random ones would prove better. "

I figured many opponents would fight for castle 10, or put down a distributional amount on castle 9 and I wanted to ensure I could win a high value castle, so I choose castle 9. An aggressive, distributional player, would put 32 troops on castle 9, thus I put 33. Given I can no longer distribute proportionally, I took the troops away from castles 4 and 5, hoping my counterpart will attack aggressively on those castles, or not at all.

I thought of some sneaky in between answers, like taking towers #4-8. Generally the top heavy strategies worked well.

For 9 soldiers and 3 castles, [0,0,9] is an optimal strategy.  For 16 soldiers and 4 castles it is already difficult to find an exact solution.  Solving it approximately by using the fictitious play method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_play), shows higher coefficients placed on strategies with more soldiers on the higher points castles, but not all on the highest point castle.  This makes intuitive sense because the higher points castles are more valuable, but you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket because the other castles combined are worth more than any one castle.Therefore I chose a strategy where deployments to each castle were approximately proportional to the point value of the castle.

The best way to win will be by countering the most common strategies. The higher value towers are worth the most, but getting two lower towers will more often than not, net more value- 10 is equal or worth more than 1/2 of the tower value combinations, 9 is worth less than 1/2 of the combined pairings and so on.

Put some troops in lower value castles to try to reduce likelihood of splitting points in those areas reducing the likelihood of losing one higher point castle leading to losing the war.
1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,42,45,"The Monarch of Riddler Nation will be the player who wins the most match-ups - only victory and defeat matter, not average scores. A winning strategy will be one that maximizes the number of (often very narrow) victories.Therefore, one could do very well by concentrating all troops evenly among any combination of four castles (25 soldiers per castle) that together yield 28 or more victory points. There are 27 such combinations, all of which win against anyone who tries to spread troops more thinly among all 10 castles (e.g. [1,1,1,1,1,1,23,23,24,24]). The dominant strategy among these is [0,0,0,0,0,0,25,25,25,25], which defeats any other 4 x 25 combination (e.g. [0,0,0,25,0,25,0,25,0,25]).I think enough people will start with a variation on 4 x 25 that it is the strategy to beat. The only successful counter involves piling more than 25 soldiers into a single castle, at the expense of potentially conceding another castle. How does one beat [0,0,0,0,0,0,25,25,25,25]? Easy! [0,0,0,0,0,0,24,25,25,26]!Or better yet, [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,33,33,34]! And how does one beat that? [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,50]! But wait, that could be defeated by [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100]!If we take this to its logical extreme, the equilibrium strategy is to pile all soldiers into the highest value castle. This is because any strategy contesting a certain set of castles can be outdone by another that contests the most valuable of these castles *harder* at the expense of any single less valuable castle.However, will this actually be successful in reality? I highly doubt it. An iterated series of matches between two opponents might very well result in this strategy being used, if only for a brief moment. Opponents stack troops in the 4 most important castles until one realizes targeting only the top 3 is even better, and so on until only the 10 victory point castle is contested. But this strategy would immediately be handily beaten (45-10) in the next round by an opponent who suddenly decides to send soldiers to all castles again.Just like in the Keynesian Beauty Contest problem, most players will not take this game to its logical extreme. Here, anyone who contests only castle 10 will probably lose the vast majority of their contests. They will only beat those who contest a set of other castles with a combined value less than 10, which I think will be rather rare.I think it's quite likely that most contestants will invest heavily in 3 or 4 castles. Stacking an absurd amount of soldiers in castles 9 and 10 can defeat most such strategies by snatching 19 victory points right off the bat, with hopefully enough VP coming to me from ties or narrow victories at lower VP castles.This leaves me very vulnerable to very basic strategies (e.g. 10 soldiers per castle, or random placement) or to those that stack a minimum of 3 or 4 soldiers per castle, but I am hoping the presumed preponderance of 4 x 25 type strategies will scare people off from these types of even spreads."

This also means you are guaranteed to win with 7 castles. 10+9+8=27, so you need to win at least 4 castles as well. If you are only going to use 4 castles, you need castle 9 and/or castle 10 because 8+7+6+5=26.My first strategy was to have at least one soldier go to each castle. That way if my opponent decides to only attack 4 castles, I am guaranteed 6.My second strategy was to try to win with only 4 castles.  Since you need either castle 9 or 10, I figured they would be the most desired and soldiers would be sent accordingly. So instead of guarding both,  I decided to pick one. I decided to go with castle 9 and not 10. After that,  my options if I wanted only 4 castles were either castles 4, 7, 8, and 9 or castles 5, 6, 8, and 9. I went with the latter so I wouldn't have to win 7, 8, and 9.Once I chose my 4 castles, I had 90 soldiers left to play with and sent them by weight.  40 more to castle 9, 30 more to castle 8, and 10 more to both castles 5 and 6.

To me, the only castles that matter are 5-9. Thus, I deployed troops in the way to most likely take the higher value targets while also hopefully overpowering the lower priority castles with troops gained by sending the bare minimum to half of the castles.Also, the marginal value of 1 troop is so low that sending one to a castle on the chance that no other troops are sent seems to make sense."

The winner was 19/19/20/21/21 which won 23,812 battles out of 25,000.I also confirmed the results using a OLS regression with the ten castle quantities as independent variables and wins as the dependent variable.  OLS indicates that castles 7 through 10 have positive coefficients, 6 has approximately 0 coefficient, and 1-5 have negative coefficients, suggesting that more tests might pull towards a higher number for castle 9 and 10.

So the above deployment is (1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 32, 32, 32).I have been considering 3 broad classes of strategy.  (Obviously there are deployments which don't fit into this schema, but which may still be meritorious.) I call these classes Paper, Scissors and Stone.Paper strategies cover all the castles with forces approximately proportional to the value of the castle, for example (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,  13, 15, 17, 19).  I also consider an equal distribution of forces, 10 to each castle, to be a Paper deployment.Scissors surgically target a winning subset of castles, for example (10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 30, 30,. 30).  Clearly Scissors will defeat paper.Stone strategies target subset of castles insufficient to win on their own, but additionally hope to win or tie enough other castles to gain the extra points to win the war. (1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 32, 32, 32) is a stone strategy.  It will win if it wins castles 8, 9, and 10 and either wins castle 1 or ties any other castle.Stone loses to paper (it wins its targeted castles but loses the rest).  It mostly wins against scissors because both strategies are likely to contest at least one high-value castle, and stone's forces will be more concentrated.It's my expectation that the majority of depoyments submitted will be Scissors or paper-scissors hybrids.  My original idea was the stone (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 33, 33, 33)  This is elegant in that it wins precisely when it wins castles 8, 9, and 10, and any other castle is uncontested by the opponent.  The first condition is nearly certain against a scissor strategy since these must target at least four castles, and it will be very difficult to commit as many as 33 soldiers to any one of them.  The second condition is much less certain.  I cannot predict how many competitors will decide to contest every castle.I decided to tweak my original idea as I suspect that rather more scissor players will put at least one soldier into every castle than will put exactly 32 into one of 8, 9,  and 10.  I consider it unlikely that a scissor strategy would put more than 1 soldier into castles 2, 3, and 4, without also commuting similar or greater forces to castles 5, 6, and 7.  If he does that, it's not really a pure scissor, more a paper-scissors hybrid."

(obviously 25 troops to each could lose me 7,8 somewhat frequently).

With a nearly 2-to-1 advantage in men per point, the ""tall"" build has a lot of wiggle room for differences in castle distribution where it can still win.A ""tall"" strategy will lose to a ""focused"" strategy that sends an unusual # of men to one or two castles (not enough to win by themselves) and then small #s of men to all remaining castles... but only if the ""focused"" player picks exactly the right castles. For example, a ""1-8-9-10"" tall player will lose to a focused-wide player that sends 54 men to castle 9 and 1 man-per-point to all other castles.However, a ""focused"" build loses horribly to any ""wide"" build... and even to some ""tall"" builds. (for example, 9-focused versus 4-7-8-10 tall) Therefore, ""tall"" is the strongest overall strategy as it is only soft-countered by ""focused"".When considering ""tall"" vs. ""tall"" fights... you're going to overlap on at least a few points. By definition if you win all of the overlap points, you'll have at least 28 victory points and you will win. So it is more important to contest the points you've chosen than to send single lonely soldiers to win uncontested points - you should go all-in on the limited # of castles you have.Tall builds will be more likely to involve the higher numbers (8,9,10) than the lower numbers (you need all of castles 1-7 to win) so you should send greater-than-average men-per-point to the high numbers."

I then considered a value based model where each ith castle received (i/55)*100 troops so that 10 'value points' would be defended by the same number of troops whether they were all associated w/ one castle, or spread out among several. I used a monte carlo algorithm to benchmark both methods, testing each model against tens of thousands of randomized troop assignments. The value based model proved superior by a wide margin, but given how naive of a solution it was, I felt it wouldn't fare well against the majority of solutions. I noticed however that moving a single troop from the first castle to the tenth gave an assignment that beat this solution. This assignment however, could be outclassed in the same way. Thinking about the problem a little more, I realized only 28 points are needed to win, so I considered all or nothing strategies that heavily targeted just 4 castles with values adding up to 28. These solutions however, were the worst ones I'd come up w/ yet as losing just one of the 4 castles would guarantee failure against a typical assignment.Intuitively, it was clear that 'clumping' was easily countered by more uniform troop distributions, but my benchmarking showed that the naive value-based model I came up with initially was worse than an augmented version of that model to a slight but statistically significant degree. Since the value based model was far better than the naive clumping approach, I decided to use that model as the basis for more monte carlo shenanigans. Starting w/ the value based model,I generated random augmentations of a seed set of models . These augmented models differed by one to two troops assignments, and were benchmarked against randomized assignments like their predecessors. I would then collect the best models from one generation and use them as the seed set for the next generation. Eventually, I obtained a lot of models that look like the one I submitted, the submitted model being the best model in the last generation of assignments I produced. Looking back on my approach, I am optimistic about how this model would fare in competition. It looks a lot like the naive value based solution, but just a little bit better. I would hope my troop assignment would run into my value based solution a lot during the evaluation process, yet I have a few hangs ups. For one, I wonder if a clumping approach could work just by virtue of people playing fair. I imagine many people would submit well thought out solutions that might look a lot like my solution above. While my solution beats an estimated 95% of possible troop assignments, a clumping solution like [0,0,0,0,0,25,25,25,25,0] would beat my solution and others like it, while only beating an estimated 30% of solutions in general. Similarly, by benchmarking against random assignments, I may have included many extraneous strategies.

This would defeat a proportionate strategy which targeted the same castles.The best way to counter this is to not target castle 10 at all, and to let those smart alecs waste their resources.Therefore, my strategy is now an almost-proportionate 28 point strategy, focusing on castles 4, 7, 8, 9.

So the strategy should be to try to get enough castles to guarantee at least that many points, and not waste troops on trying to get more. There are of course a variety of ways to do this - e.g. holiding castles 1 through 7, or 4 through 8, or 19, 9, 8 plus at least one other one. Since at least 4 castles are required, I figured I would go for a strategy that requires 4 but NOT castle #10, which I imagine people on average will try to defend heavily. So I opted for 9, 8, 7, and 4. I am putting 1 person in castle 10 so that I can win a tie if someone else uses a strategy that doesn't involve castle 10 and happens to win over one of my other castles. I figure that even in the 8-9-10 concentration strategy, people are unlikely to use more than one third of their troops in a castle, particularly those less than 10, which is why I stuff 35 and 34 in 9 * 8. 7 is probably most vunerable, but if someone is using a strategy that involves castle 7 then they are likely diluting troops and chances are they have less than that there. Castle 4 is essentially a random small castle, so if someone is diluting troops to put there, I figure 10 (100 total/10 castles) is a fair number here. "

0,0,0,1,5,6,16,19,26,27,"Two things to note before going to the computation method. Firstly, the deployment 10-tuple should be weakly increasing; it makes no sense to devote more men to a less valuable castle. Secondly, there is no single deployment that beats all others. To see this, observe that (0, ..., 0, 100) is not best, as it is beaten by (0, ..., 0, 50, 50, 0). For any deployment other than (0, ..., 0, 100), take the first castle to be assigned a number of soldiers >0, and move one of them to the next (higher value) castle. This slightly modified deployment will win. [As the set of possible deployments is finite and ""beats or ties"" is 'total', we can see that ""beats or ties"" is not an ordering relation.]This means that we're not trying to find (or approximate) the 'top' deployment, as there isn't one. Rather, we're trying to find the deployment that will beat the majority of submissions. As a first guess, let's randomly generate a bunch of (weakly increasing) deployments [more on that below], and see which ones beat the most of the other ones we generated. We might be tempted to just see which one gets the highest winning percentage and put that one in. But, we're not trying to get the highest winning percentage against random deployments, but rather against submitted deployments. So, we want to see which deployments work best against ""good candidates"" (assuming that's what people will submit).We do this iteratively. Generate a whole bunch. Send the top half through to the next round. Then play that top half against each other, and send the top half of that round's competition through to the next round after that (irregardless of how well they did in the previous round; like Masterchef, unlike Hell's Kitchen, for any fellow Gordon Ramsey enthusiasts out there). At each iteration we get a better version of ""see how they do against 'good' candidates.""My submission was the best after 10 rounds of this. I'm sure more rounds would give a better submission, but we'll see how this does.Finally, the messy details about how I made random weakly increasing deployments.  I generated 10 random independent samplings of the Unif(0,1) distribution. I then scaled them all so as they summed to 100, rounded each of them down to the nearest integer, and added whatever I needed to the last sample to make them sum to 100.  Then, I sorted them, assigning the lowest integer to the least valuable castle, etc."
