# Pew Religions Model

This directory contains the code and data behind the story [Evangelical Protestants Are The Biggest Winners When People Change Faiths](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/evangelical-protestants-are-the-biggest-winners-when-people-change-faiths/).

The model uses the [Pew Research Center's 2014 Religious Landscape Survey](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/) to measure the relative "pull" of different American religious groups by using Pew's transition matrix for rates of conversions between various faiths to compute what the eventual, stable proportions of religious faiths would be, if people kept leaving and joining faiths at the current rates until the overall numbers stabilized.
