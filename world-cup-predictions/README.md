__Note:__ Projections from June 27 onward reflect an [improvement to FiveThirtyEight's methodology for projecting knockout-round results](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/extra-time-isnt-a-crapshoot-in-the-knockout-round-but-penalties-are/) that estimates each team's probability of winning in extra time based on its SPI ratings. Projections prior to June 27 instead split all extra-time games 50-50.
