Rand Paul,Republican,9-Jan,"“If the ideas are resonating — if the ideas look like they have a chance – then it’s much more likely that I’ll make a go of this. If it looks like we’re at 1 percent, we’re not in the top tier, and it’s just going to be a quixotic sort of run, then I think it’s not something I want to do just for educational purposes.
