college-majors-rscript.R:
- My R script for parsing the data. 
- Assumes you've already downloaded the data and selected only records with non-NA values for college major (FOD1P)
- Outputs data to csv

majors-list.csv:
- List of majors with their FOD1P codes and major categories.
- Major categories are from Carnevale et al, "What's It Worth?: The Economic Value of College Majors." Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, 2011. http://cew.georgetown.edu/whatsitworth

Three main data files:
- all-ages.csv
- recent-grads.csv (ages <28)
- grad-students.csv (ages 25+)
All contain basic earnings and labor force information. 
recent-grads contains more detailed breakdown, including by sex and by the type of job they got. Full headers below.
grad-students contains details on graduate school attendees.

Additionally, women-stem.csv contains data for scatter plot in associated DataLab post on women in science/technology jobs. It is a subset of recent-grads.csv. (Small easter egg: Check out my related Shiny app: https://bencasselman.shinyapps.io/new-test/)
