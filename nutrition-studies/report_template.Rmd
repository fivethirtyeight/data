### Summary
This study provides a statistical analysis to evaluate the correlation between `r anls$food` and `r anls$char`.  Data from the study is gathered using a food frequency survey, and examines a logistical regression to evaluate how variation in `r print(anls$char)` can be explained by variation in `r print(anls$food)`.
