Public Policy Polling	Tom Jensen	"Commercial, Liberal"	No	Because we are a Democratic pollster we only deposit raw data from our polls in the progressive poll data depositories.

If that happens, I think Internet polling will pretty much be accepted after that and will grow from there. Note I am only talking about this for public polling -- much of the campaign polling industry is in races like state legislative districts, municipal races, etc., and doing Internet polling in those much smaller geographies I think is still a ways off from really being feasible."	Less than 1%	5% if Daily Kos counts as news media	Rising cost of polls	"We have significantly cut our public polling from 2012 because incorporating cellphone-only users into our polls through the Internet has increased our costs so much. There also just isn't really that much interest in this election compared even to 2010, so there's less incentive to do it."	Nevada and Hawaii	People in Las Vegas have unusual work schedules that make it harder to reach them and in both states it's hard to get a good sample of voters in key ethnic groups -- difficulties in polling Latinos accurately in Nevada cause Democrats to look worse in the polls there than they usually are and it's difficult to poll the various Asian groups in Hawaii.	8% on a national poll	1.5	4%-5% on a national poll	2	Not Applicable

I would love for you to get the opinions of academic pollsters on media use of polls that are devoid of transparency and use some sketchy methodologies.

This is a general poll, this could change depending on the amount of questions and disqualification questions.

In addition, some of the better vendors are now cross-referencing the names and addresses of voters against other commercially available list sources that include a person's race and ethnicity. While we still need to ask screening questions to confirm that the voter is of the race or ethnic subgroup we are targeting, we have found them to be an increasingly accurate and reliable sampling source."

Hawaii	"National voter databases (that we're aware of and have access to) do not use ethnicity categories that match the key voter demographics of the state.

This question wording is confusing. Do you mean have after the election or hold of their current seats? Hold all except possibly Kansas. Have 51 as a result of the election.	"Hold - without a Democrat in the race in Kansas, the independent candidate has a greater probability of carrying that seat. Have - Democrats are defending 7 seats in states Romney carried.
