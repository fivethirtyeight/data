Shachi Kurl	Angus Reid Global	"Angus Reid Global reports two perspectives on the Canadian electorate. The first, as has been our practice for almost 40 years, involves examination of the intentions and attitudes of eligible Canadian voters. The second, in light of declining electoral turnout rates, particularly among younger voters, includes a separate commentary in our analysis on the intentions of Canadians most likely to vote. Our data has been analyzed through two sets of filters: those of all respondents who are eligible Canadian voters, and those of survey respondents who are most likely to vote. The data from all respondents uses standard census-based targets to ensure a national sample that is representative of the adult Canadian population as a whole by key demographics such as gender, age, education and region. Data from likely voters applies a weighting structure that further adjusts our sample to reflect known variations in voter turnout _- specifically across age groups -_ while also filtering based on respondents' own self-reported past voting patterns and habits. We have developed this approach because we feel strongly that it is the responsible thing to do when reporting on electoral projections. With declining voter turnout, there exists an increasingly important divergence between general public opinion -_ which still includes the still valid views of the almost 40 percent of Canadian adults who donÍt vote -- and the political orientation of the 60 percent of likely voters whose choices actually decide electoral outcomes."

John Anzalone	Anzalone Liszt Grove Research	"First off, we are driving our samples based off of voter history. We have an equation of what percent of the sample is only 2010 voters and then allow in a certain but small percent of new registrants since 2011 who voted in 2012 primaries and general, as well as new registrants since the 2012 election. But we start with 80% hardcore mid-term voter history. Then we screen down verbally on the interview between very likely and somewhat likely to vote."	"Naturally we ask self-identified party affiliation and we record party registration if the state has that on the voter file. Early in the cycle, we will let party ID float, but when it gets late in the cycle, you should not be seeing big shifts in party ID, and we will at times weight it depending on what we see with the other demos. You have a model and you need to be consistent with that model."	Yes	"We almost exclusively use sample from voter files that have voter history and have been very successful with both our modeling and predictions. In midterms you have to use a voter file because it is such a restricted voting universe. You can use RDD [random-digit dialing] in a presidential cycle but voter files update new voter registration so fast these days that using a voter file is superior to RDD because with RDD you are counting on the respondent to be truthful about whether they are going to vote. And that is not realistic. We see in our drop-off studies (those who voted in 2012 but not 2010) in 2014 that so many of those who did not vote in midterms say they are going to vote in 2014. We know that is not true, and it is not true when using an RDD of midterms."	Yes	"First of all, we run partial data every day and then make sure the phone bank has quotas on demographic groups if they get out of whack. Our goal is to do as little weighting as possible and get the right interviews. You can do that by reviewing partials and seeing where you are low on groups. You then have to double-down on getting those interviews. It may be more expensive, but it is the right way to do it. You can also help this by calling more evenings. Too many pollsters (and clients) are in a rush to get data. With caller ID, no call list, cellphones, etc., you need to take more days doing proper call-back procedures and that will help you get the correct demographics instead of just overly weighting."	Yes	"It just depends. If you are in a state like Florida where you have whites, blacks and Hispanics (and Cubans and non-Cuban Hispanics), you may have to do multivariable weighting. You don't usually have to do that in homogenous Iowa. In Florida you have white progressive Democrats in south Florida but conservative cultural Democrats in the Panhandle who call themselves Democrats and vote Republican.

Darrel Rowland	Columbus Dispatch	"We are the weird one -- a mail poll. Over the past several decades, we have determined that those who choose to fill out and mail back our poll form make up likely voters. If the demographic composition of those respondents is significantly different than U.S. census demographics, we will consider weighting the results. Again, with a mail poll, our weighting technique is somewhat unique. The polls are coded for each of Ohio's media markets. If one of those markets is heavily over- or under-represented, we will first weight on a geographical basis and determine whether that pulls the other demographic factors into line. It usually does."	"No. Party affiliation has been shown to be highly volatile, especially in a swing state such as Ohio. We regard it as a variable, not a constant."

Stuart Elway	Elway Research	"We sample from registered-voter lists, which has the vote history on the record. In off years, we define a likely voter as one who has voted in at least two, sometimes three, of the last four elections.

Our objective is to explain the entire electorate, including those choosing not to vote -- not necessarily to predict the election outcome."

Mark DiCamillo	Field Research Corporation (Field Poll)	We use a scaled intention-to-vote question and couple this with their actual voting history from their voting record. (This information is available to us since we sample voters from the registered voter rolls.)	"No. We weight by party registration, which has a population value to which we can project the sample. Each voter's registration comes directly from the voter file (again since we are sampling from the voter rolls). It is not a question asked in the survey."	Yes	This is the standard method used by The Field Poll in its pre-election surveys measures.	Yes	"Yes, we will trim weights when necessary, although this is fairly uncommon. When trimming is employed, we usually limits individual weights to 3."	Sometimes	"When we do so, we weight to the party registration of the ethnic subgroups (not party ID), again since the registered-voter population value of each ethnic subgroup is known."	Sometimes	We did this once when one of the candidates included in our pre-election poll dropped out and we called back voters who chose that candidate to ask who their second choice would be.	No	"We keep our poll results strictly confidential prior to their publication. After publication, we are open to discuss them with other pollsters and polling analysts."					"We calculate and report each poll's margin of sampling error in all reports mainly because it is the usual practice in our industry.

Spanish	Mandarin or other Chinese	Tagalog		Vietnamese		Korean				Korean	"Including Spanish is standard when polling Californians. Since all of our polls over the past 15 years have included Spanish, I can't really say what our cost would actually be without Spanish. Over the past four years, we have increasingly included Asian languages, and probably have conducted about a third of then in the Asian languages noted above. When this is done, we typically include an over-sampling of each Asian American population to enable the poll to compare and contrast each of the Asian American voter segments, since they are quite distinct. This typically adds 20% to 25% to the total cost of the poll."	"Spanish-speaking Latinos are quite different demographically than English speakers. They tend to be much more downscale, with lower levels of income and education. This creates greater affinity to the policy positions of the Democratic Party, since they place greater value on government-provided services, like health care, education and the schools, jobs, and, more recently, the minimum wage. However, we have found them to be more conservative in their views on many hot-button social issues, like same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization and abortion."	Not applicable since each of our polls covers numerous poll topics and multiple election contests.	Same answer.		Yes	We tell voters that our polls are nonpartisan and are funded in part by many of the state's leading news organizations.											No					Yes	Yes	"Increasingly, we stratify our voter samples by age to ensure a proper representation of voters of all ages. Sampling from the voter rolls makes this relatively straightforward since the age of the voter is included on their voting record. We believe stratifying the sample in this way is superior to applying larger weights to the younger voter segments that can be otherwise be underrepresented in our surveys."							No					51	The odds still favor the Republicans winning enough of the contested races to put them over the top.	"To the automated voice robopollsters: Since 90%+ of Americans now have cellphones and more Americans choose to cut the cord and do without access to a residential landline phone (it now includes fewer than two in three), what are the long-term prospects of this interviewing method since automated voice message calls are prohibited by law from dialing cellphones?"
Berwood Yost	Franklin & Marshall College	"We use several different models, one based on prior voting history and the other based on perceived electoral interest and self-described intention to vote. These are discussed in our releases."	"We do weight by party affiliation (as well as region and gender) since all of our samples are designed to include all registered voters. Likely-voter determinations are then made as discussed previously. The state of Pennsylvania provides detailed voter-registration files that we use to determine the appropriate proportions. PA voters must be registered to vote 30 days prior to the election, so we use the final registration file for surveys that take place after that date."	Yes	"Why not? There are several considerations. First, the voter files include data that can be used to assess the quality of the interviewing and how representative the sample is. Second, voting history can be used to build likely voter profiles. Finally, it is more cost-efficient to use voter lists than RDD [random-digit dialing] samples. We switched from RDD samples to RV [registered-voter] lists in 2012."

Julia Clark	Ipsos	"We utilize a likely-voter model. This contains questions on: registered voter, past vote at various election, self-reported likelihood of voting on a 10-point scale, and interest in the election. They are turned into a summated index from which we make cuts based on turnout assumptions. For more granularity, we also run a regression index. Weights are applied to the whole population (either at the total level or registered-voter level, depending on the type of survey) before the likely-voter model is applied."

Bayesian		"For reporting ONLINE poll results, we use Bayesian methods to account for the non-probability nature of our recruiting processes for online samples. In many studies, we use outside information to help create informed priors to calibrate our online results. (Generally speaking for our business as a whole, we use a combination of methods depending on mode and client.)"	Yes	"Our real response is ïyes and noÍ ! Traditional reporting of margin of error accounts for sampling error, and it does not account for other sources of error that may affect a pollÍs results and its variability far more than the sampling error calculation using the sample variance. Sampling error does not adequately account for the changing nature of telephone research in the age of cell phones, callerID, and respondent disaffection with participating in surveys. For the MoE to be credible, it would need to account for total survey error within a mean square error calculation. Traditional use of margin of error for online surveys is often noted as inappropriate for online surveys, and this is a simplification. Traditional use of margins of error can be used for online surveys with the use of an underlying model. Very often, this argument is dismissed. Our organizationÍs response has been to adopt a Bayesian framework/ model. This allows us to calibrate our results using informed priors to account for the differences in the population for technologically adept versus non-adept people. We have promoted this approach in print and at conferences to work within the system rather than outside of it. In all honesty, we still report traditional margins of error for telephone research, and we use Bayesian for our online polling work. To report our telephone results using traditional margins of error, we too have to implicitly assume an underlying model _ that the percent of respondents we can reach and get to cooperate respond similarly to those that we could not contact or refused to cooperate. For our online pollsÍ results, we provide Bayesian Credibility Intervals. This provides a probabilistic measure of error in some ways analogous to Confidence Intervals and a margin of error."

Barbara Carvalho	Marist College	"Likely voters are defined by a probability turnout model.

Patrick Murray	Monmouth University											No	"While there may be some pollsters who would like to be able to do that, they would be hard-pressed to find a willing accomplice. P.S. You guys really need a lesson or two on question wording."	Sometimes or Other (please specify)	"Neither really if you you are basing this on a strict definition of the terms. Using RBS [registration-based sampling] rather than RDD [random-digit dialing] allows for a little more Bayesian application in the model, but even those who take samples ""as they lie"" apply some Bayesian thinking -- it's just not quantifiable."	This question is a good reminder that few pollsters -- especially the good ones -- are primarily statisticians. My first job in polling was as a telephone interviewer in college. I learned a lot more about the practical application of polling methodology from that experience than any of my stats classes. Good polling requires an understanding of how to communicate with individual respondents (either by phone or in writing) as much as how to weight and model databases.																															Yes		"The idea of a cap is not applicable for a true panel study. Your question asked if we use an ""online panel"" -- that could mean a variety of things now. You have to remember that many of us do non-election polling. For me a panel study is tracking indiviudal changes in attitudes and behavior over time. That's different from a so-called cross-sectional ""panel"" which is modeled to ""look like"" a population at a specific point in time. You need to clarify what you are actually asking about."

Christopher P. Borick	Muhlenberg College	We are using a RBS [registration-based sampling] sampling frame that utilizes past voting behaviors to determine preliminary screening for interviewing. If an individual has demonstrated voting patterns that qualify them for interviewing (e.g. voted in two of the last three midterm elections). During interviewing we screen out individuals who express a low likelihood of voting.	"Yes. The weighting varies depending upon if we are making inferences about registered or likely voters. For registered voters, we weight our sample to most recent party-registration statistics for the population of registered voters as was reported in the most current figures provided by the Pennsylvania Secretary of State. For likely voter samples, we incorporate previous party voting results in similar elections (e.g. midterms) as reported in exit polling during those elections."	Yes	We have transitioned in recent years from RDD [random-digit dialing] to RBS [registration-based sampling] samples only in our election polling because we feel that these sampling frames can provide us more validated voter-behavior information.	Yes	"In election polls, we cap our weights for a demographic subgroup at 2.5. Obviously as weights increase for any subgroup, there are risks that additional survey error may be introduced, so we have opted for a cap at a weight of 2.5."	No		Sometimes	"If we are conducting an experiment where individual-level analysis is necessary, we have called respondents back again. For example, we have done tests where we call back respondents after an event ( e.g. a debate, a high-profile ad) to see what changes may have occurred at the individual level. We wouldn't be able to test these individual changes with a new group of respondents. In our election polling that is reported publicly, we have only utilized new samples without calling back prior respondents. Our experiments with call backs have been done for academic studies."	Yes	Yes. I have shared results in advance of publication with other pollsters as a courtesy to give them a heads up of what we will be releasing. Other established pollsters in the state are often called on to comment on our release so I like to share what we find with them earlier so that they can get a sense of what will be coming out.	Frequentist		"We are getting more interested in Bayesian approaches but at this point don't feel comfortable using Bayesian techniques as a primary component of our methods. To be honest, we need to learn more about what Bayesian techniques can do to improve our survey quality and I imagine we will be thinking more about this issue in coming years."		"I'm not really sure by what you mean by traditional reporting, If you are talking about the difference between the standard MOE and TSE there is room for discussion about what should be shared."	Spanish											"The cost increase from English-only surveys ranges from about 15 percent to 20 percent higher. We don't do Spanish-language interviewing often (only about three times in the last four years), so we don't have a big N to look at."	We haven't done enough research on this with our samples to be able to identify if there are any differences.				Yes	This should be a requirement for any publicly released poll. A pollster should give full disclosure of the funding of a poll upon request.	Yes	We do so as a core element of our institute's mission.

"I'm not sure but this was a really long survey. I really like your work at FiveThirtyEight so I hung in there, but I think I'm tapped out for a while."
Scott Keeter	Pew Research Center	"We build a likely-voter index from a set of seven or eight questions. Scale includes measures of engagement in the campaign and in politics more generally, past voting, and intention to vote. We add one or two bonus points for young people. We then establish a likely-voter turnout percentage based on historical averages and some estimate of whether the current election is likely to be higher or lower than average. We adjust the prediction to take account of the fact that survey samples tend to be a bit biased toward more engaged people. Then we use the adjusted turnout percentage to cut the likely-voter scale. It is usually the case that the target percentage does not correspond cleanly to a set of categories on the scale, and so we have to take a percentage of the people at a particular point, plus all of the people in categories higher than that. So, for example, if our scale is seven points, we may take all of the 7s and a portion of the 6s. The apportionment is done using weighting, rather than arbitrarily splitting the group."	No	No	"Past concerns about bias in voter lists. This may be changing, and we are likely to experiment with voter lists in the future."	No	"We are mindful of the impact of extreme weights, but using a typical RDD [random-digit dialing] design, it is usually not necessary to adjust weights, other than the usual trimming that is done as a part of the normal weighting process."	No	We don't weight on party in our RDD [random-digit dialing] surveys.	Sometimes	"Occasionally we do this to determine whether voter intentions have changed. In non-political surveys, we sometimes call back respondents to gather additional information."	No	"Doesn't seem like a useful exercise. We have many conversations with our peers, but not at the point of deciding to publish a poll."	Frequentist			Yes	But only if pollsters are calculating margin of error with design effects properly included.	Spanish											I don't have that information close at hand.

"After the initial attrition following recruitment, turnover has been very low."	Yes	No	"Declining response rates could certainly lead to increased weighting, but at the same time we have been increasing the cellphone percentage in our samples (now 60%). That has had the effect of reducing the need for higher weights."							No							
Evans Witt	Princeton Survey Research Associates International			Yes	"Certainly. For certain surveys, especially state-level surveys on elections, RBS [registration-based sampling] can be an excellent choice."			No		Yes	Call-back surveys are a valuable survey tool in a variety of circumstances.						Yes	There is a decades-long debate about the reporting of sampling margins of error.

J. Ann Selzer	Selzer & Company		"No. There is a wonderful chart at Pollster.com that shows how widely polls vary when they ask party ID. It is not a fixed variable, therefore inappropriate for weighting. [http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/party-identification#!showpoints=yes&estimate=custom]"							No	"When I first joined The Register in 1987, we were calling about the 1988 caucus. A strategy in place was to bank ""warm"" caucus-goers. We'd simply call back a random sample of people we had already polled and mix them with new caucusgoers. Once I ran the crosstab and saw that George H. W. Bush was wining with one group and Bob Dole with the other, we halted that practice immediately. We had no explanation for the difference, but there it was."						Yes	"Well, the reporting of the margin of error is okay. It's how people interpret it. More then 90% of the time, if it is mentioned, it is to say that the race could be closer, or the other person could have the lead. It is equally likely the race is farther apart. It seems a matter bias that one possibility is reported without the other, equally likely, possibility reported."																	Yes	"It's a principle of disclosure. If the respondent is going to give us time, what we can give in return is transparency."	No	It's not part of our business model.									Yes					Yes									No

Jay H. Leve	SurveyUSA											No	Never in 22 years. Never even occurred to me to do so until this minute.																								No	"Public opinion polls should not be ""loss leaders."" A media sponsor is a critical second-set of eyeballs on every questionnaire we draft and on every set of research results we release.

Andrew Smith	University of New Hampshire	"We ask several questions about voter registration, interest in the election and voting in past elections, to create a context in which it is easy for a respondent to say they are NOT going to vote. We continue only with respondents who say they will definitely vote or who will vote unless an emergency comes up. In addition, we read an option to each election question that allows respondents to say they will skip that particular race. We do not weight voters on their propensity to vote."	"No, this is nuts! There is no parameter to weight to."	No	"The states we most typically poll in (New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine) have same-day registration. In New Hampshire, this typically is between 5 percent and 15 percent of the electorate. Using registration lists systematically excludes these people. Also, lists never have contact information for all voters. This systematically excludes those for whom no information is available."	No	Has never been an issue.	No		Yes	Quality control.	No	What would be the point? We publish all of our results regardless of what others look like.	Frequentist			No	"MSE [margin of sampling error] is least important source of error.
