Each respondent is either a likely voter or not.	No. I weight by party registration from the RBS [registration-based sample] list.

"Generally, our likely-voter screens are in the tradition of the Gallup screens, which have historically used a series of questions to identify likely voters. When clients request it, we can use a system that gives each respondent a weight representing their relative likelihood to vote."	"Only when necessary to have the party affiliation within a range that is determined by examining our own polling data from the previous election cycle for governor or president that best applies to the upcoming election, looking at an average of polls for previous similar elections that were close to the election outcome, but most importantly, calculating the base partisan vote for statewide education posts as a percentage of the total vote for governor or president, whichever applies to the upcoming election. There has been great consistency in our party affiliation for most polls, and with rare exceptions, we have only had to weight party affiliation by 2 or 3 points, and any party reweighting has only been requred about a third of the time."	Yes	"In election polling, we do this almost exclusively. (Although I should clarify that they are still random samples, just drawn from a more restricted sampling frame.) First, we believe that it simply doesn't make much sense to include people who can't vote in the frame parameters when trying to assess an electoral outcome. We wouldn't include Canadians, for instance, so why would we include non-registered Americans!? Second, voter lists usually provide more information about respondents (like voter-propensity scores, party propensity, etc.) than you'd get from an RDD [random-digit dialing] sample. Even if we don't generally use these scores for weighting, they're valuable to use as validity checks for the data.

"It depends on the type of election, how close the poll is to Election Day, and whether there are voter propensity scores available on the particular voter file. So, there's no single formula. But typically, we first apply a liberal likely-voter screen when drawing a sample. For example, in state-level Senate & gubernatorial polls we have conducted within the past two weeks, we have selected our random samples from among registered voters who have voted at least once in the past three even-year elections (2008, 2010, or 2012), or first registered in December 2012 or more recently. We have experimented with including (registered) individuals with no recent history of voting, but their response rate tends to be negligible, and those who do respond tend to select ""undecided"" in matchup questions at a very high rate. This effect may be heightened in IVR [interactive voice response] polling (which is the method we use nearly exclusively), but I don't have live-caller numbers with which to compare. Our second step is a self-rated voter-likelihood question. When we are more than a few weeks out from an election, we usually use that question simply as a crosstab, rather than a weighting variable. But in a poll close to an election, particularly when early voting is underway, we will use the likelihood question as one of our weighting factors, advantaging people who say they have already voted, and reducing the impact of those who say they're not yet sure when or how they're voting (if they say they're NOT voting, they are typically dropped). We have found that self-identified early voters tend to track with final results pretty closely. On the other hand, those who aren't sure when or where they're voting also tend to have high ""undecided"" numbers, so weighting them down affects the undecided number much more than the head-to-head candidate numbers. Finally, in a general-election poll just before an election, we may also apply a voter propensity score adjustment (we wouldn't do this in a primary or a local election, because nearly everyone in those samples is likely to have a very high propensity score, and there's very little variability in those scores). However, applying a propensity adjustment often makes the weights more extreme for a small number of respondents (i.e., high-propensity individuals from low-propensity demographic groups) without changing the topline result in any appreciable way. In such cases, we tend to stick with our demographically adjusted results without adding propensity scores to the mix."	"There is not ""party registration"" in every geography in which we poll, so it's impossible to do any one thing consistently and uniformly."	Yes	It is impossible to do a RDD [random-digit dialing] poll in a congressional district.	No		No		No		No		Frequentist		"It's what I was trained to do in graduate school. And it seems to work well in polling. (Ironically, it probably doesn't work as well in psychology, which is the field in which I was trained.) We don't, however, go out of our way to stress the binary nature often associated with frequentist methods (i.e, is the result within or outside the MOE [margin of error]?) -- I prefer to opt for an effect-size approach over a significance-testing approach to the degree possible."

"We have a database of voters with vote history. Each sample that we pull includes households with any general-election vote history of household members, or households with new registrants.
