The key Senate battlegrounds this year are also places like Alaska, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, etc. where most of the public pollsters don't have a ton of experience.

Higher in 2014	"The very term ""polling"" will soon fall out of the vocabulary altogether, or else be relegated to archaic usages such as candlepower and horsepower. Historians will write that ""polls,"" such as they now exist, lasted for 100 years, from about 1930 to about 2030. ""Polls"" were preceded by representative democracy and will be replaced by direct democracy. Viewed in this context, it is no wonder that polling in 2014 will be less accurate than was polling in 2012. Like chickens whose heads have been severed but who do not yet realize they are dead, pollsters continue to torment respondents by barging into respondents' lives unannounced. At present course and speed, pollsters will have obsoleted themselves before Nate Silver turns 50.

"You have mis-framed the question, and your answers will lack inspiration as a result. The battle is not between the phone and internet. The battle is between a small sample of respondents (chosen only because it is too expensive to talk to everyone), and talking to everyone, which by 2030 for sure, and possibly sooner, will be just as easy and no more expensive, than talking to just a handful. Polling can only thrive when the alternatives are worse.
