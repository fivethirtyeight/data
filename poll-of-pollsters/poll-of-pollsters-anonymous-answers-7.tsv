I use exactly the same methods for both (turnout models, weights, etc.). But I think that in private polling, you're also likely to do more experimenting with alternative turnout models at the behest of your client, who then, in turn, may be biased toward, and even leak, the best-case scenarios from their perspective."	"I think modeling primary electorates is virtually impossible. Each cycle draws voters depending on the slate of candidates, or lack thereof.

About the same	"I think turnout is a little uncertain. Republicans/Trump voters have been more likely to vote throughout the cycle but it appears to be shifting with Democrats/Clinton voters becoming more likely to vote. Uncertainly about turnout makes it difficult to ""predict"" the final margin."	Doesn't surprise me -- but the difference lies in analysis as much as margin of error.

B	"On the one hand, it's probably fairly objective and informative to the public (although more so for outlets that conduct a large number of public polls in major races, and less so for outlets that do not, and thus provide you with fewer gradable data points). On the other hand, it's also kind of rude, and I'm not sure it makes the connection to the the real lives of the people who make a living in this business and who are well trained and making every possible effort to be accurate. Along those lines, it would be a lot more credible and acceptable if FiveThirtyEight also tried running its own polls so you had a hands-on understanding of the challenges involved. Additionally, and maybe the worst unintended side effect from your perspective, I think it encourages herding. If people want to avoid getting crappy grades from you, the smartest thing they can do is produce results that are in line with the polling average (we NEVER did this at Merriman, BTW). Because we all know that the voting outcomes are likely to regress toward the polling mean, it's just mathematically the most sensible thing to do. And worst-case scenario, you may end up really wrong, but no more wrong than average. So, bottom line, I think the grading system, because it is so influential, potentially encourages poor behavior as much as it calls it out."	too little		Not sure		Not sure	They're likely testing various turnout models and not comfortable until they map against actual voting data.	No	"I think they are using too small a panel and potentially spoiling it by going back over and over (turning these folks into higher-information voters). I think it's an interesting idea as an experiment, but not as a tracking poll like they are using it. Essentially I think they are misusing it."	Not as much scrutiny of their methodology. They are less rigorous and robust.	Oversample and more weighting.	"Obviously the final debate will be big, but will it significantly move the polls (and predictions)? It's unlikely. There are also rumors floating around that more leaks (for both candidates) are coming, which could have an impact."

About the same		Not surprised. i don't know the answer to the second question.	Less	"Most reasonable people have learned from their mistakes in 2012 (and 2010 and 2014) about listening to unskewers. If someone is trying to unskew a shit poll, they've just made it a shit poll that is more favorable for their preferred candidate. It's still shit. And most unskewing people right now are frantic Trump partisans who can't acknowledge that their preferred candidate is not actually the preferred candidate of most of America. That Clinton supporters were unskewing polls when the race got close reflects poorly on them as well. There are a lot of people happy to support a walking 4chan commenter as long as they believe he will lower taxes and punish women and minorities, because they view the world as a zero-sum game. If someone else is better off, then I must be worse off. It's like they don't understand how the world works."

Hillary Clinton				Same						What are the biggest lessons you learned from the 2016 election cycle?
About the same	"Higher third-party performance leading to potentially wild swings as those third-party candidate voters either show up or don't, plus the insanity of Donald Trump makes the polls much more likely to be off, but in opposite ways. If Trump keeps cratering, insulting everyone who isn't a non-college educated white man and/or a racist, earlier polls will be way off. Also, so many polls are wrong about who is actually on the ballot in states."	"Not surprising, but very interesting. Margin of error (or some new metric) should include some indication of the effect of the weights (i.e., margin of errors of the unweighted bases of the smaller subgroups that are weighted up to the degree that they have an effect on the overall topline should somehow be incorporated). Also, although this is not an margin of error matter, the way each pollster defined their turnout model should be made clear and transparent -- this seems to also be a major factor in that Upshot analysis."

There are so much data out there at this point, I hardly miss it. My understanding is it has not been released because they could not figure out how to do an accurate likely-voter screen."	Not sure	Not for horse race -- but OK for other reasons that are not being reported. The weighting is way over the top and concern about the Heisenberg principle.	Private polls are more expensive and time-consuming.	"That Democratic polling primary ""bias"" is a result of shit polls that assumed not enough non-whites due to problems reaching non-English speakers or cell phone users.

Not sure		Not sure	"I don't know their methodology, but unless they are integrating new panelists in each wave and rotating panelists between waves it seems a risky strategy. A methodology without ""new voters"" creates respondents who are viewing the election as ""panelists"" not as voters and their is no way to correct for the bias that introduces."	"Private polls have more of an agenda, one way or the other."	That pollsters need to let the polls tell the story of the electorate without dictating their expectations and stifling what the poll is supposed to do.	The sweet meteor of death.

Better no poll than a bad poll.	Yes	LA Times/RAND tracker and Rassmussen	Not sure		Not sure		"Yes, because private polling (especially results that don't get presented to the public) is designed to be useful for campaigns, rather than about trying to create a news story. You will ask questions that you never would release to the public in an attempt to understand the race and how everything will go. This year is a presidential year, so it should be basic to poll. If there are differences (which I have noticed), it will be because the public poll you are comparing to is poor, rather than a problem with all public polling."

Worse	"I think there is more potential movement in the actual race potentially still to come. Also, wild swings (more than usual) in non-response bias depending on day-to-day candidate behavior."	"They didn't surprise me, because I compare our results to other polls. The wildly different numbers of non-whites, or younger voters, or party ID clearly will lead to different results. Using voting history compared to voter response as to vote likelihood is another issue that can cause problems with newly energized voters. Basically, polling is a magic combination of working with lots of different sources attempting to model something that doesn't exist, and no one can be proven right or wrong in an election until after it actually takes place. Pollsters may have fixed issues from previous years that overcompensate or cause new problems. Margin-of-error reporting is basically a crap-shoot, because the normal calculation is based on a random-digit-dialing sample, which very few pollsters use anymore."	More	The media polls we are seeing are oversampling Democrats by as much a 10 percent based. It is not because they cannot do it right. Most pollsters are trying to save money by not doing the hard work of hand-dialing mobile phones. The polls are inaccurate and that is being proved right on Election Day.			C-	A long conversation.	too much	"There seem to be more online polls in this cycle than in the past. While they are less reliable, they are also less expensive to commission."

Not sure		Not sure	"All innovation should be encouraged. Those who suffocate the innovators are not scientists, they are scared children."

There are economic consequence for us, since people have started looking at these ratings as a shorthand for quality. Our rating is wrong, and there seems to be nothing I can do about it. I like the idea, but it has to be accurate and real time."	too much	"Online polling is usually panel-based and therefore self-selecting and not random. You may need a 36-year-old white guy, but that white guy on a panel is going to be different from a white guy who isn't on a panel."	Yes	"I see that FiveThirtyEight adds most polls to their model, regardless of methodological rigor and tries to ""adjust"" them. Things like the Ipsos state polls with few interviews -- or other similar ones with either low sample size, poor methodology, etc. -- should not be included in my opinion. It also encourages those pollsters to continue their use of obviously incorrect methodology (see Nate Cohn on LA Times poll for instance)."	Not sure	"It's funny. They said they were not going to do horse-race polls, but I sense they are collecting the data. Maybe they are taking a cycle to figure out likely-voter modeling. But, you know, this year is unlike any other year, so how do you use any previous year to predict what is happening this time?"

After all, it's what drives success in the real world of polling. The criteria used for pollster ratings should not be so disconnected from that reality."		"Some in the media are doing a good job of reporting on the polls and providing insights into the election that are valuable. There is never too much of this type of reporting.

Worse			Same								Yes	"NBC/WSJ — Of all traditional pollsters, they've seemed to put out the biggest outliers this election cycle. The first was back in February when they had Cruz beating Trump (contradictory to everyone else, and many media organizations grabbed onto this and made it a bigger story than it actually was). This past week, they put out a poll of 447 likely voters that had Trump up by 11. Swings are not that dramatic, especially for two very well-known candidates. To that point -- I would avoid using any poll with a sample size under 1,000 to forecast an election. That sample is too small to conduct accurate analysis, and it does not let you delve into demographics in an insightful way."	Yes	Everyone involved in public polling should.
