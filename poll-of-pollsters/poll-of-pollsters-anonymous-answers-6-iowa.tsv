Democrats: YouGov; Republicans: Opinion Savvy		Democrats: Gravis Marketing; Republicans: Gravis Marketing		Live telephone			"I wish there was a ""toss-up"" category here. Results were decidedly mixed, with some IVR and online/phone blends performing about as well as some of the live caller polls (e.g., Emerson's last poll compared to Quinnipiac's last)."		No					Not sure		"I think more folks staying in the field longer would probably be beneficial. Also, I think many of us will want to examine some ways to better use registration-list samples (given contacts in the lists without phone numbers, non-working numbers, etc.)."		Don't poll in New Hampshire		Win by 10-19 points						Hillary Clinton			Donald Trump												"Better explanation of Internet polling. Is it emails, Facebook, have them define panels? Do they change the weights often? What criteria do they weigh?"
N/A		Des Moines Register/Selzer	"There is no one who knows Iowa caucus polling better than Ann Selzer and she missed not only the horse race, but also the composition of the electorate (i.e. evangelicals)."				"Haven't examined. Most were live telephone, I believe."									"Old-fashioned politics still works; political consultants, ground game, data, and pollsters matter."					Win by 0-9 points					Hillary Clinton					Marco Rubio										
Selzer and Co.	"Caucus polling is always difficult, and this year was especially difficult. In answering this question I am focusing most on polling that took place in the last two weeks of the race. The Selzer poll captured the general trends of the race well, and while the final poll may have been a little wide of the mark on Trump, it was very good a further down the ballot as it nailed Carson and Paul's support. Some late polling may have captured the narrower gap between Trump and Cruz, but Selzer was stronger up and down with the top five. Judging the Democratic side is inherently problematic given that vote totals are not reported--just the delegate equivalents. I think an honorable mention should go out to Emerson College for their last Republican poll as they captured Rubio's strong finish very well. Given their methodology and relatively small sample size, they did well with this last Republican poll. They were likely wider of the mark with the Democratic one (but, again, it is hard to say that definitively)."	Public Policy Polling	"Again, polling the caucus is tough stuff, and I am just focusing on the polling in the final two weeks for a consideration of the horserace. PPP was wide of the mark on both sides, Democratic and Republican, despite relatively large sample sizes."		IVR (Interactive Voice Response)																	Second place			"There is not a lot of time for a huge swing, but I think it is possible. There is a real ceiling to Trump's support, and I think we will be seeing him bounce up against it as the field narrows and more voters cast their ballots. I expect Trump to have a rough time going forward. His lack of favorability within the party's primary electorate, coupled with his baggage for a general election, make him a very unlikely nominee. Cruz's victory in Iowa is actually not surprising given that he is a candidate more suited to Iowa and his ground game was superior (high support amongst evangelicals, etc.). Beyond Iowa, things are rough for Cruz, as well."	Hillary Clinton					Marco Rubio										
					IVR (Interactive Voice Response)		"I am biased since this is the method we used, but our poll saw Trump surge 10 days out and then saw it tighten. I was surprised to see online work well as when we tested it (unofficial and unreleased data). Bernie was ahead by double digits."
