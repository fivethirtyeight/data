### Police Killings

This directory contains the data behind the story [Where Police Have Killed Americans In 2015](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-police-have-killed-americans-in-2015).

We linked entries from the [Guardian's database on police killings](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-map-us-police-killings) to census data from the American Community Survey. The Guardian data was downloaded on June 2, 2015. More information about its database is available [here](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/about-the-counted).

Census data was calculated at the tract level from the 2015 5-year American Community Survey using the tables `S0601 (demographics)`, `S1901 (tract-level income and poverty)`, `S1701 (employment and education)` and `DP03 (county-level income)`. Census tracts were determined by geocoding addresses to latitude/longitude using the Bing Maps and Google Maps APIs and then overlaying points onto 2014 census tracts. GEOIDs are census-standard and should be easily joinable to other ACS tables -- let us know if you find anything interesting.

<b>Note regarding income calculations:</b>

All income fields are in inflation-adjusted 2013 dollars.

`comp_income` is simply tract-level median household income as a share of county-level median household income.

`county_bucket` provides where the tract's median household income falls in the distribution (by quintile) of all tracts in the county. (1 indicates a tract falls in the poorest 20% of tracts within the county.) Distribution is not weighted by population.

`nat_bucket` is the same but for all U.S. counties.
